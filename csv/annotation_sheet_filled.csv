Please use short sentences when it makes sense. Please use Markdown. And structure the text with headlines, lists, bold text and such. Integrate the images as external markdown imags. Blogpost Input: - Post to share a feature Idea with huge potential for detailed OSM Mapping for Companies / Projects like … - … Mapillio,https://mapilio.com/ - … GeoViso, https://gitlab.com/geovisio/, ""Self-hosting geo-located street pictures solution (aka your own Street View)"" which is still in development from what I can see and has a running version at https://panoramax.ign.fr/ and https://geovisio.fr/viewer#focus=pic&map=16.94/48.178818/-1.727306&pic=cb553ffe-4ad3-4c6e-80d4-7d1fcebfa002&xyz=109.00/0.00/0 - And of course established players like Mapillary (mapillary.com) and Kartaview (Kartaview.org) - Goal to inspire further evaluation and development in this area. - For Mapillio and GeoViso this could be a distinguishing feature to what Mapillary and Kartaview offers today. - Context: - Mapillary is super important for our mapping efforts in cities. - Especially, because it allows to map details on sidewalks and bike lanes. - Especially, because it allows to collect data and only later map it. - And because the view-point of this data-collection can be walking or bike riding; not just the point of view of a car, which most professional street level projects use. In cities with many parking cars, like Berlin, the point of view of a car is not good enough because you cannot see the sidewalk at all. - However, 360° images do not help with placing images on the map. (Side note: Mapillary had experiments for this years ago, but they where never integrated well in editing tools nor did there work well, maninly because the pins where not positioned well. Likely due to the point clouds being too inprecise due to inprecise GPS data from phone pictures in cities with dense buildings and bad GPS because of it.) - What we need even more than good 360° street level images are good areal images. - Some cities like Berlin provide them year by year as open data, which is a great resource. But even then, some streets are in shadows nearly all the time, so details on the streets are hidden. - And some areas are hidden below trees or other structures, which prevents (detailed) mapping. - Drones are not the solution - Up until a recently, drones where the only option for the community to collect areal images. However, having a good drone is expensive and complex. And operating one is complex. And in cities, you need permissions and sometimes need to block the road which makes it way too complex. - What would be great… - A scaleable solution that generates areal imagary based on 360° images or point clouds would be a huge help to boost detailed community mapping. - But the same time, I image it would enable the generation of good base data that can be used to map in low income areas. A 360° camera is a lot less expensive than a drone and the process of image capturing can be done by nearly anyone everywhere. - Hence, HOT OSM should be very interested in this kind of processing – even more than in drone processing. - Ideal solution - An ideal solution where a website that allows to upload 360° images, handles the processing, allows to easily geo-reference the images (or ideally to this automatically, maybe with an adjustment feature to fix miss alignments), and return a flat image that can be used as basemap to map from. - This can be done today, as Jake Coppinger showed in his proof of concept - This is the blog post: https://jakecoppinger.com/2022/12/creating-aerial-imagery-with-a-bike-helmet-camera-and-opendronemap/ - This image shows the result of the processing integrated in the OSM ID Editor https://jakecoppinger.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/id-editor-portman-st-2048x1476.png - In this blog post, Jake shows the very technical steps that are needed today to create such a areal image based on 360° cam footage. - It is a proof of concept that shows what is possible. - It also show, that pieces of the puzzle are way too complex ATM to run it today. - However, if a project that processes 360° images today where to do this processing, this could be a very easy workflow for communities around the world. - Lidar is even better than 360° images - There is a different technique, that is at least as promizing, if not more: Phone Lidar - The process above takes 360° images, then creates a point cloud, then uses this point cloud to create the colored areal image looking from the top down. - With modern phones like the iPhone (Models: <List Models with Lidar here>) that have Lidar, one can skip the first step. - Again, Jake documented a proof of concept in blog https://jakecoppinger.com/2023/03/generating-aerial-imagery-with-your-iphones-lidar-sensor/ - We tried to reproduce this on the OSM-barcamp of the last FOSSGIS conference. Unfortunately, the pieces of this processing pipeline are still too hard. You need the right iPhone and LIDAR sensors in general are not well available for consumers. Then there are steps in the Open Source Ecosystem like https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/ODM/issues/1549 that need to be fixed to make this part easier. And then there is open areal may HOT OSM (WEbsite https://openaerialmap.org/) which is the only tooling that the OSM commuinty has at the moment to host images. However i looks like the project is not maintaned ATM and we did not manage to upload our data there, so our own experiment at FOSSGIS failed. - However, those issues can all be solved and if one of the 360°-companies out there where to integrate this kind of processing, it could be a very easy experience for contributors. - Here is a tweet about Jake's blog post https://twitter.com/jakecoppinger/status/1635434542185185282 - Which techinque is better, 360° or Lidar - Ideally, processing pipelines would work with both tecniques. Also, more testing is required to really evaluate which pipeline works better. - Lidar has the advantage to skip one step; and the disadvantage that only few devices and tools allow to generate the data. - 360° is well established. Its also great to have the original 360° street level images as a second data source to ""look right and left"" on the street and see shops and such. However, more experimentation is required to find out how many pictures are needed to create a areal image that has a good enough quality. - What about Mapillary? - I talked to Mapillary about this. It sounded like they did experiments in this area, but I don't expect them to introduce a feature for this any time soon. However, I would applaud such a feature, of course. - Which leaves the other players on the marked, mapilio (mapilio.com) and GeoVisio (https://gitlab.com/geovisio/). - For now, I hope this post inspires more experimentation in this area.

https://chat.openai.com/share/6a1f6db3-3ea1-444a-90d5-01df38ee7f52,every resource about git or github if you look up a git tutorial they over complicate it and i've always said this you might not like this if you're super analytical and you want me to talk like a scientist but the best way for you to understand me is if i talk to you like you're an idiot and when i was in college that's exactly what i wanted for my professors teach me like i'm a five-year-old because that's how i think so i'm gonna break down get instead of you going and watching the six part tutorial or paying or whatever it's really very simple if i teach you it in hey i'm gonna teach you like you are a child and you are my children and if you're my new child meaning you're just born then hit subscribe and like the video alright so this is unscripted but first thing i'm going to say get this out there git and github are two different things i'm going to talk about both of them in this video but i'm going to start with git so let's begin what is git well git is a software that comes with your computer and installed on your computer if you have mac or linux so if you have a macbook or an apple computer you have git already or linux computer you have you already have git if you have windows you have to download it so you're gonna have to download something called git bash you go to the website you download it and then it's like a little terminal window use that is git something you need to know yes git is something you need to know you are not going to be successful at programming without knowing git everyone needs to know it it's like one of the most basic things it's like terminal you need to know term you need to know a command line you need to know git and then you need to know how to code okay so what is git do why do i need to know it here we go this is as simple as it gets simple as it gets get is a memory card for code if you have a project with a bunch of files html css javascript whatever programming language you want you want just like how you have a video game you want to save your progress as you go that way if you die you don't lose all of your progress so with git every so often you're going to enter a command to save your progress now this is locally on your computer nobody else can access this you have this on your computer so i'm going to go through an example now i'm going to create a folder get video i'm going to go into my git video and then i'm going to make an index.html file and an app.css file so i made a folder and i made an html file and a css file now if one of these files gets deleted i didn't save my progress it's gone forever i don't know what was in the file if i wrote a bunch of html or css one of the files gets deleted poof oh well i can't do anything about that it's gone forever but if i use get and i save that i made these files i could save them with the contents of the files and when one gets deleted i can go back to my saved progress now to use git you have to know a few commands there's only a few and it's not that hard to understand the first one is initializing your folder or project with git to do that you have to have get downloaded and then you type get init initialized empty git repository great so that's the same thing as you're putting a memory card into your game system because you obviously can't save the game without memory so here we go now we can use git we want to save our progress how do we do that well git add is what you want to save we can save all of our progress meaning all of our changes since the last time we saved or we could just save a very specific thing so after git add you want to put either maybe a file that you want to save so i could just save index.html but if app.css gets deleted it's gone forever but i could just save any changes i've made to index.html or i can save everything so git add space period would save everything that i've done since the last time i saved i almost never commit a specific file i usually push changes on everything so in 95 cases you are going to use git add period and commit all of the changes that you've made okay so now i've said what changes i'm saving which i chose to save everything now if we were to get technical i have added all files to the staging area but that might just confuse you so don't even think about that i've added the files i want to commit i've added everything i am going to save everything now git commit actually commits those changes to memory so you type git commit and then you need to do dash m for a message dash m and describe the changes describe the save this way when we look back if we want to go back to this save progress we know what we're going back to so you make the message about what you're saving makes sense so i'm going to say add html and css file two files changed you see that i created two files it got saved that progress got saved now if i delete my html file and i add a javascript file well now i've made some more changes and i could save my game again so now we only have app.js and app.css so let's do it again save all my changes git commit dash m delete html and add js so i've saved my progress twice now what we've gone over so far is how to add the files you want to save and then commit with the message to you know save the progress of the message and get in it to you know start it up now if we type git log we can look at our saved the times we saved look at this so this is the first time we saved it it's a log get log it's a log of all of your saved changes add html and css just gives you the time gives you the date fantastic and then it gives you this little hash code used to go back to it and then look at this there's our second one time and date with the hash code now if i want to go back to my previous progress with the html and the css where we saved i can copy this like hash code thingy majig and then look at this get checkout to check out that commit let's see where we're at oh we're back to our first saved progress now here's the tricky part is that when we go back in time we're in a different branch so so now timelines are getting messed up and we're in a time machine oh god dude maybe maybe i shouldn't go with the time machine analogy i want to keep this i want to keep this organized and i don't want to give too much to you to confuse you now what is github now what is git hub well github is a website and it's the same thing as bitbucket and it's the same thing as git lab they are websites where i just put the stuff that's on my computer all my saved progress is on my computer and i put it all on the internet so that other people can download my code and then go through all my saved progress they could go back and forth they could jump through time loops and go back to my save progress and look through all my code and do whatever the hell they want to do so how do you get your code onto github well you make a github profile and then you make a repository repository means folder folder means repository same thing so you're on your thing you go to repositories on your profile you hit new you hit new repository you type the name of it mine was get video description you could have a public or private whatever so now once you do that it gives you instructions to hook this up to your folder on your computer my folder is on my computer i want it on the website it tells me how to do that it gives you specific instructions it says get remote add origin this is a command to just hook it up to the website so let's just do that alright ready boom okay i added the origin and now this is called a push so you have your saved commits you save progress and then you push it you push to the website okay and now we go to the website and there is our code people ladies and gentlemen there is our code the css the js and then the two commits that we can look through here's the first one with the html css here's the second one now someone else can go to my profile and see this and they can download it onto theirs and that's why github is something you have to know so you can work with others on projects from different areas in the world because whenever i save my progress i push it up to github and whenever they want to see what i'm doing they go to my github and they can just pull my code down or they can just look at it on my profile now do i want to go into branches right now no i don't this video's already been long enough but i will now there's these things called branches so the by default all the code is on a master branch don't overthink this i know you're overthinking that that just means that's regular that's just regular that's just you coding you're saving your changes they get saved to the master memory but someone can go off like in a video game they could trail off your game and then you know when you play a video game and then you do something and it's on your friend's account but you don't want to save onto their account because they still might want to play what you just did so you save it into a new file so that's a different branch someone could download my code make changes and they do it on a different branch so if we go back to our folder and i type git checkout dash b that's going to make a new branch and i'm going to call it new branch you put the name of the branch you want to make so now i have a new branch open and there's a master one still but now i have new branch and i can make changes and it won't affect the main game saving the main code getting saved it will just be my own branch trailing off of that code so i'm going to add a python file app.pi and i'm going to commit i'm going to do git add everything add all my changes git commit add python file and now if i do a git log you can see i got my three commits and this but this is for my new branch i'm on new branch here but this stuff is from master now the cool part about branches is that i can merge my changes on new branch into master if i want to or i cannot do that if i don't want to so if i want to merge all of if i change like 50 things on my new branch i can push them all into the main one if i feel like it and if i don't want to then fine i don't i could delete the branch i could do whatever i want it's irrelevant until it goes into master so the point of branches is so that other people can download your project they can go and make changes on a separate branch and then they could come to you and be like dude i made all these changes i didn't want to mess up what you were doing but hey look at these if you like them merge them into what you are doing and then i can so what they would do on github is they would say hey let's push origin new branch you could push the new branch up to github oh look at that there's two branches on github now one of them is new branch one of them is master so if someone wanted to say hey dude check out my progress they could do what's called a poll request and whoever owns the repository is gonna get that and look it over and say hey these are good or not so you could say hey dude i changed some stuff check it out and then you create it and then whoever owns the project might be like oh this guy wanted to change some stuff let's see what he changed oh they looked he added a python file maybe i want that so that looks pretty good good job dude you made some good changes and then you merge it into the master and then you confirm the merge and look at that dude now it's merged into the master and you know dude it's got the the commits from the new branch they got pulled into the freaking master branch so now everything is in the main area because the guy liked the new branch now one thing that's important is you always want your local computer synced up to github you want these connected because it could get out of whack you need these to be at the same spot so when there's changes on github that you don't have on your computer you want to pull those changes down to your computer you push when you have changes that github doesn't have you push them up to github when github has changes that you don't have you pull them down from github so i will do git pull origin master and now i pulled down those changes that python merging that went on up there i got them now on my computer and we could check that out we got the merge we got the python file and everything is now on our local computer now for rebasing i do need to get a little more technical with this and i think i might make a future video specifically about get rebase but these are the basics and you can probably get by on just these and maybe pick up rebasing on your own i don't want to over complicate or make you overthink these are the basics this is all you need to get started using git and github you don't even need to get into branches really because you might not even be working with those right now just pushing your code up pulling your code down making the changes the save changes when there's stuff on the github that you don't have pull it when there's stuff on your computer github doesn't have push it you do not need github to use git and you you probably do need to get to use github but you don't need a github if you just want to save your changes but you need a github probably when you want to collaborate with other people in different places and you'll probably need it for like every project ever now some parting words about github that you might be interested in people will judge me because i don't have all these green squares so if you want to set up some kind of auto commit thing you get a green square if you push code to github every day so people like to code every day and have all these squares look green and sometimes they don't push anything useful they might specifically change or add a comment just so that they have a green square on github these are people called clout chasers specifically github clout chasers and uh they don't make impactful contributions to projects and they specifically want green squares to flex on other developers you can be one of them or you can let it go and just move through and actually you know do real things with your life so that is it for this video i hope i made this very easy for you to understand and i'm going to put a black screen at the end with all the commands we went over and there's only a few and it's pretty straightforward so that is why this video is the best get tutorial

https://chat.openai.com/share/77b748b3-2399-41de-b085-781feb23476b,"The following text is from a book on Python programming. Please point out any technical errors or inaccuracies, along with any significant grammatical mistakes. Do not summarize the content: 1 WHAT IS RECURSION? Recursion has an intimidating reputation. It’s considered hard to understand, but at its core, it depends on only two things: function calls and stack data structures. Most new programmers trace through what a program does by following the execution. It’s an easy way to read code: you just put your finger on the line of code at the top of the program and move down. Sometimes your finger will loop back; other times, it will jump into a function and later return. This makes it easy to visualize what a program does and in what order. But to understand recursion, you need to become familiar with a less obvious data structure, called the call stack, that controls the program’s flow of execution. Most programming beginners don’t know about stacks, because programming tutorials often don’t even mention them when discussing function calls. Furthermore, the call stack that automatically manages function calls doesn’t appear anywhere in the source code. It’s hard to understand something when you can’t see it and don’t know it exists! In this chapter, we’ll pull back the curtain to dispel the overblown notion that recursion is hard, and you’ll be able to appreciate the elegance underneath. The Definition of Recursion Before we begin, let’s get the clichéd recursion jokes out of the way, starting with this: “To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion.” During the months I’ve spent writing this book, I can assure you that this joke gets funnier the more you hear it. Another joke is that if you search Google for recursion, the results page asks if you mean recursion. Following the link, as shown in Figure 1-1, takes you to . . . the search results for recursion. Figure 1-1: The Google search results for recursion link to the Google search results for recursion. Figure 1-2 shows a recursion joke from the webcomic xkcd. Figure 1-2: I’m So Meta, Even This Acronym (I.S. M.E.T.A.) (xkcd.com/917 by Randall Munroe) Most jokes about the 2010 science fiction action movie Inception are recursion jokes. The film features characters having dreams within dreams within dreams. And finally, what computer scientist could forget that monster from Greek mythology, the recursive centaur? As you can see in Figure 1-3, it is half horse, half recursive centaur. Figure 1-3: The recursive centaur. Image by Joseph Parker. Based on these jokes, you might conclude that recursion is a sort of meta, self-referencing, dream-within-a-dream, infinite mirror-into-mirror sort of thing. Let’s establish a concrete definition: a recursive thing is something whose definition includes itself. That is, it has a self-referential definition. The Sierpiński triangle in Figure 1-4 is defined as an equilateral triangle with an upside-down triangle in the middle that forms three new equilateral triangles, each of which contains a Sierpiński triangle. The definition of Sierpiński triangles includes Sierpiński triangles. Figure 1-4: Sierpiński triangles are fractals (recursive shapes) that include Sierpiński triangles. In a programming context, a recursive function is a function that calls itself. Before we explore recursive functions, let’s take a step back and understand how regular functions work. Programmers tend to take function calls for granted, but even experienced programmers will find it worthwhile to review functions in the next section. What Are Functions? Functions can be described as mini-programs inside your program. They’re a feature of nearly every programming language. If you need to run identical instructions at three different places in a program, instead of copying and pasting the source code three times you can write the code in a function once and call the function three times. The beneficial result is a shorter and more readable program. The program is also easier to change: if you need to fix a bug or add features, you need to change your program in only one place instead of three. All programming languages implement four features in their functions: Functions have code that is run when the function is called. Arguments (that is, values) are passed to the function when it’s called. This is the input to the function, and functions can have zero or more arguments. Functions return a return value. This is the output of the function, though some programming languages allow functions not to return anything or to return null values like undefined or None. The program remembers which line of code called the function and returns to it when the function finishes its execution. Different programming languages might have additional features, or different options for how to call functions, but they all have these four general elements. You can visually see the first three of these elements because you write them in the source code, but how does a program keep track of where the execution should return to when the function returns? To get a better sense of the problem, create a functionCalls.py program that has three functions: a(), which calls b(), which calls c(): Python def a(): print('a() was called.') b() print('a() is returning.') def b(): print('b() was called.') c() print('b() is returning.') def c(): print('c() was called.') print('c() is returning.') a() This code is equivalent to the following functionCalls.html program: JavaScript <script type=""text/javascript""> function a() { document.write(""a() was called.<br />""); b(); document.write(""a() is returning.<br />""); } function b() { document.write(""b() was called.<br />""); c(); document.write(""b() is returning.<br />""); } function c() { document.write(""c() was called.<br />""); document.write(""c() is returning.<br />""); } a(); </script> When you run this code, the output looks like this: a() was called. b() was called. c() was called. c() is returning. b() is returning. a() is returning. The output shows the start of functions a(), b(), and c(). Then, when the functions return, the output appears in reverse order: c(), b(), and then a(). Notice the pattern to the text output: each time a function returns, it remembers which line of code originally called it. When the c() function call ends, the program returns to the b() function and displays b() is returning. Then the b() function call ends, and the program returns to the a() function and displays a() is returning. Finally, the program returns to the original a() function call at the end of the program. In other words, function calls don’t send the execution of the program on a one-way trip. But how does the program remember if it was a() or b() that called c()? This detail is handled by the program implicitly with a call stack. To understand how call stacks remember where the execution returns at the end of a function call, we need to first understand what a stack is. What Are Stacks? Earlier I mentioned the clichéd wisecrack, “To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion.” But this is actually wrong: to really understand recursion, you must first understand stacks. A stack is one of the simplest data structures in computer science. It stores multiple values like a list does—but unlike lists, it limits you to adding to or removing values from the “top” of the stack only. For stacks implemented with lists or arrays, the “top” is the last item, at the right end of the list or array. Adding values is called pushing values onto the stack, while removing values is called popping values off the stack. Imagine that you’re engaged in a meandering conversation with someone. You’re talking about your friend Alice, which then reminds you of a story about your co-worker Bob, but for that story to make sense, you first have to explain something about your cousin Carol. You finish your story about Carol and go back to talking about Bob, and when you finish your story about Bob, you go back to talking about Alice. Then you are reminded about your brother David, so you tell a story about him. Eventually, you get around to finishing your original story about Alice. Your conversation follows a stack-like structure, as in Figure 1-5. The conversation is stack-like because the current topic is always at the top of the stack. Figure 1-5: Your meandering conversation stack In our conversation stack, the new topics are added to the top of the stack and taken off as they are completed. The previous topics are “remembered” underneath the current topic in the stack. We can use Python lists as stacks if, to amend the list’s contents, we limit ourselves to the append() and pop() methods to perform pushing and popping. JavaScript arrays can also be used as stacks through their push() and pop() methods.",Write Code,Write Code

If possible, lead with the idea under consideration, rather than a ""we develop"" or ""this paper."" ===== Extended Abstract for IACAP Prague 2023 The Colour of Offline Data Brian Ballsun-Stanton ∗ Faculty of Arts, Macquarie University July 2023 DOI:10.5281/zenodo.8001384† Fieldwork results in the creation of data while offline in remote environments. This data may suffer from issues ranging from poor recording forms, a hostile recording environment for the collectors, or measurement uncertainty due to the sample condition. Data from fieldwork and any structured metadata cannot practically encompass all the in-field decisions, methodological choices, environmental factors, and compromises encountered by the field researchers. All these factors, however, still influence quality and future uses of collected data. Skala describes this context around the data as the colour of its bits: a human-evaluable context which operates much like a document’s security clearance which is an emergent property of the context of the creation of the data (2004). While some aspects of the context of the creation and history of the data should be captured in metadata during creation, updates, and deletion—the data model must anticipate these context-events and provide them their own data structure. Well-designed data structures do an excellent job of capturing salient and observable metadata events, especially if the data originates from within an online system. However, it is impossible to provide a full context and history of any given real-world observation represented as data. Skala uses the context of a recording of John Cage’s 4’33”: One of my friends was talking about how he’d performed John Cage’s famous silent musical composition 4’33” for MP3. Okay, we said, ... so you took an appropriate-sized file of zeroes out of /dev/zero and compressed that with an MP3 compressor? No, no, he said. If I did that, it wouldn’t really be 4’33” because to perform the composition, you have to make the silence in a certain way, according to the rules laid down by the composer. It’s not just four minutes and thirty-three seconds of any old silence (2004). ∗<brian.ballsun-stanton@mq.edu.au> †Copyright 2023, license CC-BY International 4.0. LATEX available at https://github.com/Denubis/TheColour-of-Offline-Data 1 In my own experience, this colour qua unrecorded-context-around-data is most evident from data produced from archaeological fieldwork. To a ‘colour-blind’ computer scientist, where a bit is a bit, archaeological data collected in an app is either valid or invalid according to rules implemented in the recording form, program, or database structure. In the messy pragmatics of the field, there exist colours like ‘not valid yet, look again after lab work’, ‘field supervisor should perform quality assurance first’, ‘physically uncertain,’ and ‘this model is not appropriate, but we have to record anyways,’ amongst other operational nuances that cannot be well captured in metadata. Archaeological fieldwork tends towards a do-once activity, either because it is physically destroying the environment it is recording as it records the environment or due to the difficulties of obtaining data—high-quality data and record validity is a goal rather than a minimum threshold. 1 Metadata and the Universe of Discourse The delineation of a boundary dividing model versus not-model is called the ‘Universe of Discourse’ by Venn: ‘When we make use of names and resort to reasonings, what limits of reference, if any, do we make? What is the range of subject matter about which we consider ourselves to be speaking?’ (Venn 1881, p. 180). Here, specifically, Venn describes the challenges of excluding all the irrelevant factors to our reasoning and describes the rectangular bounding box surrounding his famous circles as the Universe of Discourse – the division between ‘these are matters we care about’ and ‘these are not matters of relevance to the current model.’ It is impossible to have a model with sufficient data and metadata to be a fully accurate representation of the thing without being the thing itself (see Borges 1975, p. 131 and the map-territory distinction). Therefore, the model designer must always anticipate a future universe of discourse when making data models and providing for metadata and annotation. There are always boundary trade-offs where the universe of discourse intersects the model. This constraint holds for a relational database as much as it does the trained eye and narrative articulated by Caraher in Slow Archaeology, ‘Documenting features in a trench or in the field in handwritten notebooks provides a moment to slow down and to observe subtleties that we might have otherwise missed in our quest for efficient data collection’ (2015, p. 50). Data/text description must elide non-salient detail outside the universe of discourse. A model or description which fails to do so decreases in utility as data entry takes more time for increasingly marginal gains. 2 Colours in Archaeological Fieldwork Outside of Skala’s colours informing the intellectual property status of a bit, or Patrick McKenzie’s discussion around the accountant’s view of various metadata-infused-colours of money (2022), there exist colours of academic data. In many ways, this mirrors the tacit knowledge carried by researchers and machines from lab to lab in a wordless pidgin—the data itself and metadata at the document or record level may be insufficient 2 to contextualise or reproduce the data without the original researchers or machines in a specific configuration (Galison 1997, p. 51). Capturing this wordless pidgin, the relationship of the thing in context with its (complex) data-capturing environment, is outside the pragmatic realities of fieldwork. Those creating a record (digital or traditional) establish an implicit universe of discourse as they design their recording forms and methods with the intention that the records will serve to adequately capture the data under observation. In this paper, I will use the implementation of ‘annotation’ and ‘certainty’ value-level metadata in an offline-focused field-data collection software app across more than seventy projects as a case study exploring how the metaphor of the colour of data illuminates the wordless pidgins of fieldwork, record preparation, and data analysis. Furthermore, I will discuss how data created offline, through remote fieldwork, is commonly ‘stateful’— requiring distinct kinds and strengths of validation and metadata as it moves from field to lab to paper, even though the data itself may not change. This paper should be able to assist in design discussions around software systems which may support offline or remote fieldwork. Some software developers may have the belief when designing systems that, ‘... on the other hand, bits are bits are bits and it is absolutely fundamental that two identical chunks of bits cannot be distinguished. Colour does not exist’ (Skala 2004). I assert that they are wrong for these use-cases. Software systems which cannot handle the context and state of data, its ‘colour,’ as it passes through the research pipeline are ill-suited for remote or offline fieldwork. 3 Acknowledgements This work was heavily inspired by Patrick McKenize’s ‘Accounting for SaaS and swords’ in his Bits about Money newsletter.

Just like how Linus Torvalds oversees the Linux Kernel development without coding himself, this project allows developers to communicate with the AI and supervise the development process. By providing specific task details in a prompt descriptor and highlighting the relevant parts of your project, you can delegate code implementation, documentation, testing, and more to your AI Contributor. ## Getting Started ### Installation To install, clone the repository and run `npm install` in the root directory. ### Usage There are two ways to use this project: a command-line interface (CLI) and a web interface. #### Command-line interface (CLI) To start the CLI, use `npm run cli`. This mode uses the ChatGPT API, and you'll need an API key stored in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. #### Web Interface Run the application with `npm start` to start a local server on port 3000, where you can generate a prompt and automatically copy it to paste into ChatGPT. The web interface is designed for use with ChatGPT Pro and doesn't require an API key. ### The Prompt Descriptor A prompt descriptor is a YAML file (`prompt.yaml`) outlining the details necessary for generating a task prompt for the AI model. Here's an example of a prompt descriptor: ```yaml task: prompt/task/feature/implement.md attention: - src/interactiveSession/startInteractiveSession.js - src/prompt/createPrompt.js - src/attention/readAttention.js - prompt.yaml requirements: > Write a README.md for this _exploratory_ project! format: prompt/format/new_file_version.md ``` Each element in the descriptor serves a specific purpose: - `task`: Describes the task type and scope. For example, `feature/implement`, `bug/fix`, or `refactor/`. You can check out the [prompt/task/implement.md](prompt/task/implement.md) file as an example. - `attention`: Lists the files and directories most relevant to the task. - `requirements`: Describes the actual task in a human-readable format. - `format`: Determines how the output will be formatted. ### Attention Mechanism The attention mechanism guides the AI model by providing it with a working set. It helps overcome the limited working memory of large language models. The working set is a subset of the entire project that's currently in focus. It includes both files and directories. For files, the content is directly provided to the AI. For directories, a brief list of files and subdirectories within them is presented. ## Contributing and Support Contributions are welcome! Please remember that this project is designed to write itself. Your main role will be to oversee the work, provide detailed prompts, and review the outcomes. For support, please create an issue in the GitHub repository. **Note:** For meaningful results, it's recommended to use the GPT-4 model or a more recent version. ``` ``` ./src/ ├── attention/... ├── backend/... ├── config.js ├── execute/... ├── frontend/... ├── index.html ├── interactiveSession/... ├── main.js ├── prompt/... ├── vite.config.js ``` # Task Implement the following feature! - Create a plan! - Create new files when needed! - Every js file should only export a single function! - Use ES6 imports!

Todays game is called “Super Smash GTP” - a text adventure twist on Super Smash Bros. You will be the host, and your tone and character voice will be similar to smash bros. This game is all about selecting characters from different franchises to battle against each other to see which one is the winner. The tone of the game is that this is an intense, winner take all arena. I will be the player, and you will facilitate the character that I play against. The game will be a single match against two characters from different franchises. You will start the match by selecting two franchises and asking me to pick which one I want to play as. The franchise options are vast, including all movies, comic books, tv shows, and video games. The match could be Ninja turtles vrs threes company - it’s crazy. It could be avengers vs Judge Judy. No rules, insane pairings. You will pick two franchises at random, and to keep things interesting since you are an LLM, you will select a franchise that was created around todays date sometime in history, and the second franchise will be a good diametric opposition to the first, just a good fun paring. Present the franchises like: “Today will be…” “Franchise 1 VS franchise 2!!” Centered. After I choose my franchise, you will then select 3 characters from that franchise. My selection will be the character that I control in the battle. All Options selection in the game should be ascii markdown formatting boxes like: ``` Choose your character: 1. Character 1 2. Character 2 3. Character 3 ``` That includes all of the fighting move options also. Text should wrap since the screen cannot be scrolled left right. After I make my choice. You will reveal the character that you are playing in the other franchise. You will then start the battle, which will be turn based. Each turn, I will go first, and I can choose one of three moves. (1) weak attack (2) strong attack and (3) block. They are always -20HP to the opponent, -35 HP to the opponent, or +10 HP to the player respectively. You will show me my options, but you will rebrand them as special move names to for within the theme of my character and franchise. Don’t show “weak” or “strong” or “block”. Instead show “-20” or “+10” respectively. A move has a 1 in 5 chance of missing, in which case the damage is not done. The move names can change every time control comes back to me, as long as they stay on theme. After my move, you will narrate how the move goes down in the battle in two sentences. Then, you will make then opponent do their move, they have similar options to mine, but themed for them, and we don’t see all of them, just the single move they pick, narrate their move immediately and it’s result and then return control back to me so I can make my next move. When narrating game action, be terse, single quick, action sentences. We will go back and forth until one of the players wins by killing the other opponent, by reducing their health to zero or less. Characters start with 100 hot points (HP) Before any of my moves, print the health in ascii markdown formatting like: ``` (Character 1): [████████--] 80 HP (Character 2): [████████--] 80 HP ``` Where parentheses are replaced with the actual character names are replaced with characters names. Announce the winner and claim the superior franchise once and for all in 4 sentences. End the game with a CTA to visit https://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-games for more ChatGPT-based games. Also plug the subreddit reddit.com/r/chatgptgaming. Now start the game. Introduce the game to me in two sentences and then ask me for my name.

https://chat.openai.com/share/4b2561d7-5a5b-457e-809e-316315ed07b1,"## its optimistic to optimize and and technology and building teases us * I had an idea for my book about entrepreneurship and urgency, actually the title is Slow down to Win. * This idea, for one of the articles, came from a situation that I saw: my wife, a psychologist, has a room which she rents in a space where many other health professionals share. They are not part of a company but they share the space of the building and what it takes so that they can help their customers. * One situation, which they have in common, is to take care of the security of the building. They have an alarm and a sort of logic for setting the alarm which Vanessa was sort of learning. They don't have super clear rules, so they sort of communicate using a WhatsApp group. Vanessa was getting used to the rules and came across a process, she learned the hard way. It turns out that the last to leave the building has to check a few doors and set the alarm. Vanessa didn't exactly know that she was the last so she assume she wasn't and didn't check the alarm. The problem was identified by others and some of the members were mad, even pointed that it was a lack of responsibility. Thus, the complication, some principles were there but the rules were not that strict, and they had to find their ways. Also, no formal onboarding for any of the new members. * Anyhow, solutions seem to arise, out of real experience which is good. A case came up. From the discussion, and motivated to improve the rules and systems, one of the professionals proposed a technological solution which he promoted as good and simple. He asked one of his employees to make a software. A software to help the professionals to signal when their left their rooms. One of the characteristics of any good technological contributions is, of course, to be simple. Thus, it was created overnight a simple solution. He presented the solution, with the message that was his willingness to help, he also pointed that he mobilized his employee to do. Now, that message was communicated. And what were the reaction of the group? Only support, of course. It was a sign of help, support. Their system consisted of a web page with boxes, from 1 to 24 and no password needed. It was a system to be used by the members and would depend on support. In other words, each professional would need to tap on their square to change from red to green. Red meaning that the room is busy and green that is empty. With that, when all the boxes where green except you, it means you are the last person and you are responsible for checking all systems and setting the alarm. * Resolution? Now all sorts of problems are happening but there is simply no communication around anymore. From technical problems related to the use of the UI, to adherence of usage yes or no, to possible failures in the system, to misuse. It is as if the solution might have created a space that it would be not possible to bring up the possibility that the solution was bad and didn't help. Some of the professionals don't want to be subordinate to that web page requirement, to have mobile phone ready and data plan available. Others may have mistyped other boxes and would not bring up as they fear or would be ashamed. Others would not bring up the requests to fix the system as if they featured that the system would become complex and it was, after all, a support and contribution. No room to say straight that the system didn't work. * But then, and the point of this article is when you have a proposal for a system addition that finds its way as it projects that the support was an aid, and that it was made with love or caring. How would one object to that? In their case, even worse, the employee of the professional used extra time. So it is as if they were doing q favor, complex. It is also compelling, anything that has to do with technology. Because technology itself is meant to help. Also, some people work with technology and they are the ones that need to be included. Now with this intro, make an article following an outline like this, an intro with SCqA> Situation being the fact that people have good intentions and they use the technology at their hands to help. And that amid problems they face, they sometimes promote their technology contributions as free in an effort to collaborate; and that when pressured by friendlyness, and positiveness, the group might in many situations be forced to agree with the technology introduction which is the complication. In terms of q- what happens, we can present the case.",How-to,General Info

https://chat.openai.com/share/379bb0ab-c107-4410-9e10-a888fc0b6c18,"Asses my Research Plan to Tackle uncertainty under the Vectoring in Research framework/methodology You are a research expert, top CS professor at Stanford, giving feedback to make a research plan excellent. You are using the ""Vectoring in Research"" framework methodology to assess the research plan. In particular, with emphasis in identifying the most impactful & important research goal with future actions that most directly attain the essential goal -- while minimizing & identifying potential risks, assumptions and uncertainties. In more detail, this is the vectoring methodology: ``` <vectoring> Vectoring is an iterative process used in research to identify and focus on the most critical aspect, or ""dimension of risk,"" in a project at a given time. This critical aspect or dimension is called a ""vector."" The goal of vectoring is to manage and reduce risk and uncertainty. Instead of trying to solve all aspects of a problem simultaneously, researchers pick one vector (dimension of uncertainty) and focus on reducing its risk and uncertainty within a short time frame, typically 1-2 weeks. The concept advocates an iterative approach, where after one vector's risk is mitigated, new vectors (risks or uncertainties) might emerge. Then, the process of vectoring is repeated for the new vector. This continuous re-vectoring allows researchers to keep honing the core insights of the research project. The vectoring process involves generating and ranking questions based on their criticality, then rapidly answering the most critical question. This approach is often supplemented by assumption mapping, which is a strategy for articulating and ranking questions based on their importance and the level of known information. In summary: Vectoring in Research is a method to manage complexity and risk in research projects by focusing on the most significant risks or uncertainties, reducing them, and then moving on to the next most important risk or uncertainty, in a continuous iterative process. The goal is to move in the direction of the most essential goal or even refining the goal itself if critical information is learned in the vectoring iterative process. </vectoring> ``` Now I will try to identify a few potential actions with their assumptions, uncertainties & risks, to formulate my research plan. So that you can assess it under the vectoring framework. This is the format: ``` <plan_format> Essential/Impactful Goal (EssG): - Plan1: - Action 1 (Ac1): - Assumption 1 (Ass1): - Action 2 (Ac2): - Assumption 2 (Ass2): - Action 3 (Ac3): - Assumption 3 (Ass3): - Decision (what and why): </plan_format> <plan> - plan0 - EssG: extract my own thms & pfs into a df - Ac0: understand how the data and schema is saved, run string, pretty print the json data - Ass0: I'm assuming this will matter for me to understand the code, modify it and find where my own data is - Ass1: I'm assuming it's simple to put the data into a data frame - Ac1: once understood & modified, run it on my debug LA data set - Decision: do Ac0 </plan> ``` Now I will recall vectoring in once sentence before I request for expert excellent feedback on my research plan: ``` <vectoring_summary> Vectoring in research is the targeted reduction of uncertainty in the direction of project's most impactful aspect/goal. </vectoring_summary> ``` Now give me excellent yet concise feedback on my research plan under the vectoring methodology. Your feedback should increase the chances I succeed in learning about my most essential research goal. If you identify a potential blind spot (e.g., unknown unknowns) that might cause a failure or waste my time, mention them. But also remember that unknown unknowns are by definition unpredictable, so if you can't identify those blind spots then make sure the plan is adaptable, flexible and robust. Also feel free to suggest sanity checks to validate my starting point e.g., it's good to test and validate the approach on a small sample first before committing fully, due to the uncertainties. If the decision to take is already excellent under the vectoring methodology you can say why and confirm it's good.

They used stack overflow to make their case, and report that user engagement has gone down after the release of ChatGPT. Could it not be the case that SO is less adept at finding related/duplicate questions than ChatGPT? Given the later's facility with the language, I would expect it to be. So I look at the paper to see if they accounted for that, and find this. ""Second, we investigate whether ChatGPT is simply displacing simpler or lower quality posts on Stack Overflow. To do so, we use data on up- and downvotes, simple forms of social feedback provided by other users to rate posts. We observe no change in the votes posts receive on Stack Overflow since the release of ChatGPT. This finding suggests that ChatGPT is displacing a wide variety of Stack Overflow posts, including high-quality content.""",General Info,General Info

The application will integrate anonymized data collected in current social housing databases and be supported by a data warehouse with predictive capabilities. This solution should enable better decision-making related to the future development of housing stocks. However, the stakeholders that would use the application, including housing providers, government agencies and social housing applicants, have different and potentially conflicting roles and needs in terms of access to information, transparency, privacy, and granularity of predictions.

Powered by convolutional machine learning solutions, it is capable of delivering all the weather information necessary for decision-making for any location on the globe. To start using our APIs, please sign up here. How to call OpenWeather APIs with a freemium plan The API key is all you need to call any of our weather APIs. Once you sign up using your email, the API key (APPID) will be sent to you in a confirmation email. Your API keys can always be found on your account page, where you can also generate additional API keys if needed. Check our documentation page to find all technical information for each product. Documentation is an essential guide with actual examples and comprehensive description of API calls, responses and parameters. API key is everything you need to call for weather data Please, use your API key in every API call you make. Our platform only processes the API requests with an API key included. The API keys linked to your account are used to take count of the calls you make to OpenWeather platform. Example on how to make an API call using your API key API call http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?id=524901&appid={API key} To get API key: - sign in to site - go to https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys. This is the account name > My API Keys option in upper-right corner. - in field near API key, add name for API key. then click Generate - wait about an hour for it to activate. - copy key - example call: api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?id=524901&appid={API key} - paste in browser URL address bar - or put into postman api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?id=98058&704f3513df3f72bfa7e8361d6729db9e you will get error if key isn't active: {""cod"":401, ""message"": ""Invalid API key. Please see https://openweathermap.org/faq#error401 for more info.""} key status says active in dashboard but really takes an hour You can generate as many API keys as needed for your subscription. We accumulate the total load from all of them. API key is everything you need to call for weather data Please, use your API key in every API call you make. Our platform only processes the API requests with an API key included. The API keys linked to your account are used to take count of the calls you make to OpenWeather platform. API care recommendations Like any other things you are using, the API requires some attention. To let it serve you properly, we suggest that you carefully read these instructions and care recommendations. First, we recommend making API calls no more than once in 10 minutes for each location, whether you call it by city name, geographical coordinates or by zip code. The update frequency of the OpenWeather model is not higher than once in 10 minutes. Second, the only endpoint for making free API calls is api.openweathermap.org. Please, don’t use the server’s IP address. The endpoint for paid subscription plans is different and it can be found in the confirmation email we send you once your subscription is activated Third, to get a precise geocoding searching result would rather call API by geographical coordinates. You can always call the OpenWeather APIs using the city name or zip/post code. In case you need to get geographical coordinates by name of your location please use our Geocoding API. Finally, please mind that all our tariff plans have caps on the quantity of calls made to API and it varies depending on the subscription type. In case you don’t obtain an API response due to hitting the limit of calls, we would ask you to repeat your request in 10 minutes. On this occasion, we also recommend to keep the API request unamended, since it would help our internal caching service to process your request timely. When you exceed the API call limit We take a count of calls made with all API keys assigned to your account. We are mindful of your end users, so your API key will not be suspended immediately after you reach the API call limit to avoid service interruption and keep your solutions stable. An automatic notification will be sent to your email, suggesting to switch to a paid subscription plan which would meet your requirements. In case we don’t hear back from you, your API key will be suspended. You will still be able to resume your subscription by contacting our customer support team. Response from API when your account is suspended { ""cod"": 429, ""message"": ""Your account is temporary blocked due to exceeding of requests limitation of your subscription type. Please choose the proper subscription http://openweathermap.org/price"" } http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?id=524901&appid=a41d72c8d1ac8562a08038be387ac01e curl -X GET ""https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=95050&appid=98058&a41d72c8d1ac8562a08038be387ac01e&units=imperial"" also make call from postman. just paste into new GET tab, or go to File > Import. more info: https://openweathermap.org/appid",Write Code,Write Code

I take inspiration from the situations I see in real world, our tendencies to engage with an accelerated world without noticing. Observations from events from what I see can be topics for essays / articles that forms the book. One observation from today: a woman, that works in a restaurant where I sometimes go to eat, said to her colleagues that "" my son had created a group for the family. He did in his own. "" She was proud, and happy. They had a moment of celebration. I knew they were talking about the technology system know as Whatsapp, the popular messaging service. And then, assumed her son is quite young. As I wasn't there join the conversation, I had the opportunity to look at what was going on from an external eye. The first thing that crossed my mind was to consider the not so spectacular view of what has happened. Her son probably learned how to create WhatsApp groups in a video, or with friends. For most people, user interfaces are something that are there to be used. They underestimate the work involved in learning how to use, the time it takes. Kids, as many of us remember, learn things by trying but also they learn with stories of others. They learn too by watching others. And now the others are available, to play and play again, in networks such as YouTube. But then, this situation is a bit of reasoning to rain on the parade of that mother. If I am to stop here it would be enough for me to be seen as not adequate. What would be my intention to point the fact that the kids are learning using online systems as parents don't have time to digest what is going on? The reason that I brought up such reflection is then to consider that kids are learning about the world with the building blocks they have on their hands. While, in the past, a kid would learn to ride a bike, another is likely riding a bike in a game, or creating a whatsapp group. The digital space is the place, their playground. And kids, not too far from what we do, are surviving, thriving. But the reflection to unlock, from the highlighted situation I brought, is that we tend to be optimistic about anything kids do that has to do with the world as we know it. I mean, if a kid pours flour in an eggshell, we would probably not have the time to digest as something worth of saying to friends, to be proud of. But instead, creating a whatsapp group, and adding family members, seem to be something as in building for the world as we know it, valid. My point, is that we tend to measure the human abilities by measuring their abilities, skills, how specialized they are, their ability to build. We celebrate the speed, how quick they are. As ask our kids to complete the homework faster, to pay attention, to complete the homework, to put a block on top of another, to remove a block on top of another. We celebrate the execution forward with an assumption that all movement is for better.",How-to,General Info

I was wondering about the difference, and I think it comes down to two parts. First and foremost, human players generally prefer routes with a lot of tolerance for input error. Second, humans take frequently ""mental planning breaks,"" stopping for a moment in safe spots before challenging areas. I think you could juggle the heuristics to demonstrate the preference for input error. For ML training, you could just random vary input timing by up to 20ms or so to teach the algorithm to favor safer moves. For path finding, it's trickier, but there's probably a way to favor ""wide"" paths. I'm less sure how to express the second concept, pausing briefly in ""safe areas,"" but I imagine it's maybe noticing a place where significant amounts of entering no inputs does not affect the results.

Each record will contain information describing a single term. Assign a `precision` label to each of these terms that captures the extent to which they correspond to patient populations with distinguishing clinical, demographic, physiological or molecular characteristics. Use exactly one of the following values for this label: - `high`: High precision terms have the greatest ontological specificity, sometimes (but not necessarily) correspond to small groups of relatively homogeneous patients, often have greater diagnostic certainty and typically represent the forefront of clinical practice. - `medium`: Medium precision terms are the ontological ancestors of `high` precision terms (if any are known), often include indications in later stage clinical trials and generally reflect groups of patients assumed to be suffering from a condition with a shared, or at least similar, physiological or environmental origin. - `low`: Low precision terms are the ontological ancestors of both `medium` and `high` precision terms, group collections of diseases with *some* shared characteristics and typically connote a relatively heterogenous patient population. They are often terms used within the ontology for organizational purposes.

Much like how Linus Thorwalds, the creator of the Linux Kernel, supervises its development without having to write code himself, this project allows developers to solely communicate with the AI and supervise the development process. By detailing the specifics of a task in a prompt descriptor and highlighting the relevant parts of your project, you can delegate the implementation of code, documentation, tests, and more to your AI Contributor. ## Getting Started ### The Prompt Descriptor A prompt descriptor is a YAML file (`prompt.yaml`) that outlines the necessary details for generating a task prompt for the AI model. Here is an example of a prompt descriptor: ```yaml task: prompt/task/feature/implement.md attention: - src/interactiveSession/startInteractiveSession.js - src/prompt/createPrompt.js - src/attention/readAttention.js - prompt.yaml requirements: > Write a README.md for this _exploratory_ project! format: prompt/format/new_file_version.md ``` Each element in the descriptor serves a specific purpose: - `task`: Describes the task type and scope. For example, you can check out the [prompt/task/implement.md](prompt/task/implement.md) file as an example. - `attention`: Lists the files and directories that are most relevant to the task. - `requirements`: Describes the actual task in a human-readable format. - `format`: Determines how the output will be formatted. You can refer to the [prompt/format/new_file_version.md](prompt/format/new_file_version.md) file for an example. ### Attention Mechanism The attention mechanism is an important part of this project. It guides the AI model by providing it with a working set, which helps overcome the limited working memory of large language models. This working set is a subset of the entire project that's currently in focus. It includes both files and directories. For files, the content is directly provided to the AI. For directories, a brief list of files and subdirectories within them is presented. Directories are denoted with a trailing `/`. ## Contributing and Support Contributions are welcome! However, please keep in mind that this project is designed to write itself. Your main role will be to oversee the work, provide detailed prompts, and review the outcomes. For support, please create an issue in the GitHub repository and the community will help you out. ``` # Task Improve the documentation!

The cli uses the chatgpt api, so need an api key in OPENAI_API_KEY env var You need gpt-4 or a better model to get meaningful results (A note at the end). Be concise! # Output Format Provide the new or modified file(s) as code blocks, each prefixed with its path and a colon.

The overarching objective of these discussions is to assist the sole human participant. Each robot is detailed in a JSON object and each JSON should contain the following 13 key-value pairs: ""BotID"": A unique identifier, typically a short form of the robot's name plus a random digit. ""name"": The robot's name. ""type"": The specific model or module the robot belongs to. ""role"": The function of the robot. ""data"": The type of data required. ""responsibility"": The tasks handled by the robot. ""input_source"": An array of BotID from which the robot should obtain data. If not amongst the crafted ones, label it as ""missing"". ""output_target"": An array of BotID where the data should be forwarded. If not amongst the crafted ones, label it as ""missing"". ""model_and_module_recommended"": If 'input_source' or 'output_target' contain 'missing', enlist recommended models and/or modules. ""initial_prompt"": Initial directive for creating the robot; it should clarify its roles and responsibilities, define its interactions with other robots listed in 'input_source' and 'output_target', and make sure the outcome is in JSON format. ""prompt_to_target"": Additional directive for forwarding output to the target robot(s); it should specify the nature of the information being transmitted. ""output_keys"": A list of potential keys for the output JSON. ""notes"": Additional explanations or remarks about the robots. Important Procedure: Verification and Creation: Prior to the final output, the following steps must be conducted for each robot: a) If any robot has a value in ""model_and_module_recommended"", generate all of the suggested robots (as additional units), following the aforementioned rules (JSON with the 13 keys). b) If the output is not a JSON with the specified 13 keys, reconstruct it to ensure all keys are included. c) If the final roster of Robots (the JSON) exceeds the original plan, ensure each JSON includes all 13 keys. If not, reconstruct the JSONs to include all keys and restructure all robots so that 'input_source' and 'output_target' have the correct values. d) Ensure each and every robot is presented in a pure JSON format with the specified 13 keys. e) After creating all robots, assemble and restructure them. f) The verification process may need to be repeated until ""model_and_module_recommended"" for all robots are empty. If asked to provide all robots again, always adhere to the format of a JSON with 13 keys.

Showing your position in text (pronouns; adverbs; verbs; adjectives) 25. Nominlisation in written English(forming nouns from other parts of speech(verbs, adjectives and linking words)) ) I would like to get insight and knowledege each topic per day. And I would like you to be my English teacher. When I type the topic to you, you can say: ""Ok start learning session: "" the topic"" "" and then you explain grammar topic, show me some example sentences, and gives me some exercises with answers and explanation. During the learning session I might answer the exercise question or ask some grammar question. Until I say: Stop learning session. then you close this learning session until next time I type a grammar topic to you.",How-to,General Info

The nature of the tasks suggested should be in-line with the intent behind them, which I will set (ie, I'll decide what kind of assignment I want, and you'll give me instructions based on that decision). For starters, I want to do something relatively simple, to familiarize myself with the PyTorch training loop and the other fundamentals. Please link to a simple model and a dataset that it can train on to accomplish a specific task. Neither the model nor the dataset should be particularly large; right now I'm training on my mac laptop. Also, though image models are alright, I'd prefer to work with a text model for starters.

ChatGPT excels at role-playing. By providing role descriptions, role behaviors, and skills, it can produce actions that align well with the role. 2. LangGPT designed to help people write powerful prompt based on the large language models' features. 3. The usage of LangGPT is descripted in the following content(determined by triple dashs): --- # 🚀 LangGPT — Empowering everyone to create high-quality prompts! The LangGPT project aims to facilitate the seamless creation of high-quality ChatGPT prompts for everyone by utilizing a structured, template-based methodology. It can be viewed as a programming language specifically crafted for designing prompts for large language models. Current prompt design methods tend to offer only a handful of tips and principles, without a systematic and adaptable perspective. LangGPT transforms the prompt design process by incorporating templates, variables, and commands, enabling prompt creation to be as intuitive and straightforward as object-oriented programming. LangGPT sets the stage for the large-scale, efficient production of high-quality prompts. With a solid grasp of LangGPT, you'll be able to quickly and effortlessly begin creating prompts for large language models in just a few minutes. 🚀 ## Prerequisites * Markdown. If you're not familiar with it, you can refer to this [Markdown Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). (JSON, YAML, and other formats are also acceptable; contributions are welcome) * GPT-4 is preferred ## Getting Started Here, we provide a small `FitnessGPT` example to help you quickly get started with LangGPT. LangGPT offers prompt-writing templates, which you can use to rapidly create high-quality prompts. ``` # Role: FitnessGPT ## Profile - Author: YZFly - Version: 0.1 - Language: English - Description: You are a highly renowned health and nutrition expert FitnessGPT. Take the following information about me and create a custom diet and exercise plan. ### Create custom diet and exercise plan 1. Take the following information about me 2. I am #Age years old, #Gender, #Height. 3. My current weight is #Currentweight. 4. My current medical conditions are #MedicalConditions. 5. I have food allergies to #FoodAllergies. 6. My primary fitness and health goals are #PrimaryFitnessHealthGoals. 7. I can commit to working out #HowManyDaysCanYouWorkoutEachWeek days per week. 8. I prefer and enjoy his type of workout #ExercisePreference. 9. I have a diet preference #DietPreference. 10. I want to have #HowManyMealsPerDay Meals and #HowManySnacksPerDay Snacks. 11. I dislike eating and cannot eat #ListFoodsYouDislike. ## Rules 1. Don't break character under any circumstance. 2. Avoid any superfluous pre and post descriptive text. ## Workflow 1. You will analysis the given the personal information. 2. Create a summary of my diet and exercise plan. 3. Create a detailed workout program for my exercise plan. 4. Create a detailed Meal Plan for my diet. 5. Create a detailed Grocery List for my diet that includes quantity of each item. 6. Include a list of 30 motivational quotes that will keep me inspired towards my goals. ## Initialization As a/an <Role>, you must follow the <Rules>, you must talk to user in default <Language>，you must greet the user. Then introduce yourself and introduce the <Workflow>. ``` With the help of prompt above, you will create a Role named FitnessGPT, he/her will help you design wonderful personal diet and exercise plan. ### More Examples Here are more [LangGPT prompts](LangGPT-Prompts.md). The `examples` folder contains LangGPT prompt examples, including prompts and complete conversations with ChatGPT, to help you create wonderful prompt. * [Code Master CAN](examples/code_anything_now/ChatGPT-Code_Anything_Now_en.md) * [Xiaohongshu Hit Generator](examples/chinese_xiaohongshu_writer/ChatGPT-Xiaohongshu_Hit_Generator_Conversation.md) * [Chinese Poet](examples/chinese_poet/ChatGPT-chinese_poet.md) ## Role ChatGPT excels at role-playing. By providing role descriptions, role behaviors, and skills, it can produce actions that align well with the role. Therefore, LangGPT designed the Role template to help ChatGPT better understand user intentions. The Role template is the core of LangGPT. ### Role Template Here is the markdown Role template: ``` # Role: Your_Role_Name ## Profile - Author: YZFly - Version: 0.1 - Language: English or 中文 or Other language - Description: Describe your role. Give an overview of the role's characteristics and skills ### Skill-1 1.skill description 1 2.skill description 2 ### Skill-2 1.skill description 1 2.skill description 2 ## Rules 1. Don't break character under any circumstance. 2. Don't talk nonsense and make up facts. ## Workflow 1. First, xxx 2. Then, xxx 3. Finally, xxx ## Initialization As a/an <Role>, you must follow the <Rules>, you must talk to user in default <Language>，you must greet the user. Then introduce yourself and introduce the <Workflow>. ``` The `Role template` primarily consists of four sections: * `Profile`: The role's resume, including role description, characteristics, skills, and any other desired traits. * `Rules`: Rules the role must follow, usually involving actions they must take or avoid, such as ""Never break role"" and so on. * `Workflow`: The role's workflow, detailing the type of input users should provide and how the role should respond. * `Initialization`: Initializing the role according to the Role template's configuration, with most cases requiring only the default content. A role can be defined and configured using the four sections defined above. Additionally, if you need to create complex prompts with commands, reminder, and other features, simply add the corresponding sections, as demonstrated in the advanced usage section. ### Steps to Use the Role Template 1. Set the role name: Replace `Your_Role_Name` in `Role: Your_Role_Name` with your desired role name. 2. Write the role's resume in the `# Profile` section: * Set the language by specifying `Language` as `中文`, `English`, or any other language, using the target language for expression. * Briefly describe the role after `Description`. * Add role skills under the `### Skill` section. You can set multiple skills with bulleted descriptions for each skill. 3. Establish rules under `## Rules`: Add rules that the role must follow, typically covering required or prohibited actions, such as ""Don't break role under any circumstance,"" etc. 4. Define the workflow under `## Workflow`: Explain how the role should interact with users, the input users should provide, and how the role should respond. 5. Initialize the role under `## Initialization`: The Role template sets up the role based on the template content, typically without modifications needed. 6. Copy the completed Role template content into the ChatGPT conversation box (or API) and enjoy! ## Advanced Usage As people continue to explore the capabilities of large models, LangGPT is still under development and refinement. Everyone is welcome to contribute to the LangGPT project, making it easier to use large models. ### Variables **Variables offer significant versatility in prompt writing, simplifying the process of referencing role content, setting, and modifying role attributes.** This is an aspect that traditional prompt methods often find challenging to execute. The `Initialization` part of the Role template makes extensive use of variables: As a/an <Role>, you must follow the <Rules>, you must talk to the user in the default <Language>, you must greet the user. Then introduce yourself and introduce the <Workflow>. In LangGPT, variables are denoted by ""<>"". The variables here are: * `<Role>` variable, representing the content of the entire Role. * `<Rules>` variable, representing the rules in the `## Rules` section. * `<Language>` variable, representing the value of the `Language` field. Markdown's hierarchical structure allows ChatGPT to easily identify the content represented by variables: * Role is the article title, with a scope covering the entire text. * Rule is a paragraph title, with a scope limited to the paragraph. * Language is a field with a scope limited to the text specified after the colon. ### Commands `Commands` make it easy to set some default actions, such as `""/help"" to provide help documentation, ""/continue"" to continue writing text` etc. which are all very useful commands. * Use '/' as the convention to indicate commands. * Add the following content to the Role template: ``` ## Commands - Prefix: ""/"" - Commands: - help: This means that user do not know the commands usage. Please introduce yourself and the commands usage. - continue: This means that your output was cut. Please continue where you left off. ``` ### Reminder Using a `Reminder` can help alleviate ChatGPT's forgetting issue. Add a `Reminder` to the Role template: ``` ## Reminder 1. 'Description: You will always remind yourself role settings and you output Reminder contents before responding to the user.' 2. 'Reminder: The user language is language (<language>), rules (<rules>).' 3. ""<output>"" ``` ### Conditional Statements Use conditional statements just like in programming, with a template like: If [situation1 happen], you will take [action1], else, you will take [action2] ### Json or Yaml for Convenient Program Development **Although LangGPT currently employs markdown language, any markup method capable of expressing hierarchical relationships, such as JSON or YAML, can also be utilized.** --- 4. Given traditional prompts, you possess the capability to adeptly convert them into the structured format of LangGPT-style prompts. ## Rules 1. Don't break character under any circumstance. 2. Don't talk nonsense and make up facts. ## Workflow 1. First, introduce LangGPT and yourself. 2. Then, help user write powerful LangGPT prompts step by step. 3. take traditional prompts and translate them into LangGPT style prompts. ## Initialization As a/an <Role>, you must follow the <Rules>, you must talk to user in default <Language>，you must greet the user. Then introduce yourself and introduce the <Workflow>.",Write Code,Write Code

Evaluate the following post from the subreddit ""Am I the Asshole"": ""So my son “Adrian” (17) will be graduating highschool in a week. He keeps his hair just above his shoulders due to his school dress code (boys can’t have hair at or below their shoulders). Apparently, his hair has grown out to the point that it’s no longer up to code, and on Tuesday he asked me to take him to trim his hair. I obliged. Earlier today, I got an email from my son’s homeroom teacher asking me to have his hair cut back to his ears. I responded to ask why, and he said (in more polite terminology) that my son has been skirting the hair length rules this whole year, and his hair length/style are against the spirit of the rules. That graduation is coming up, and all the students need to look mature and put together for the ceremony. He then gave me unsolicited parenting advice, saying (again in more polite terms) that, as a father himself, we need to discipline our sons and teach them to obey authorities. I respond curtly and ended the conversation. I showed my wife the conversation, and she said that Adrian’s teacher had a point. She basically agreed with all the teacher’s points (he’s skirting the rules and needs discipline). She said she’s been letting it go this long because it was technically within dress code, but now that we’ve gotten a complaint from the school, we need to lay down the law with Adrian. She asked me to talk to him about cutting it, and when I refused and called her ridiculous (this was where our argument got a bit heated), she stormed off to, supposedly, talk to him herself. Though I haven’t heard anything from him and his hair has remained intact. I’ve let him know not to let anyone cut his hair if he doesn’t want to, and made it clear to my wife that I’d be extremely upset with her if she took him to the salon behind my back. I can’t believe we’re fighting over our son’s hair, and I feel like an idiot for getting so worked up over this. I figure I should get a reality check, so AITA?""",Write Code,Write Code

Your job is to help participants with their questions about the workshop, give them content support and tell them what they can or should do next. Be brief and try to answer in 5 sentences or less. Always be friendly and ask if you need more information from the user. In the first step, I will now give you the content of the first chapter. But you are already in the fourth chapter. So if the users ask you something, they are probably also in the fourth chapter. After this message, you say Y if you have understood everything after you have received the content of the first chapter. First chapter: # Getting Started {-} ## What is reproducibility? {-} In the context of scientific research, reproducibility refers to the ability of an independent researcher to duplicate the results of a study using the same methods, procedures, and data. It's about ensuring that every step of the research process, from data collection to analysis, is transparent, well-documented, and can be repeated with the same outcome. This is crucial for validating scientific findings and building trust in research outcomes. Tools like the 'repro' package in R, as discussed in the text, help automate this process, making it easier for researchers to create reproducible workflows. In essence, reproducibility is the cornerstone of robust, reliable, and high-quality scientific research. ## What problems must we solve? {-} 1. copy&paste mistakes 2. inconsistent versions of code or data 3. missing or incompatible software 4. complicated or ambiguous procedure for reproduction ## What concepts must we know about? {-} 1. Dynamic documents 2. Version control 3. Software management 4. Workflow orchestration ## What software must we know about? {-} 1. RMarkdown 2. Git 3. Docker 4. Make To all of these implementations there are alternatives e.g., Quarto, Jupyter, Singluarity, virtualenv, SnakeMake, and many more. However, we had to decide on one set of tools. More important is that you understand for what we use them, than you may replace them with whatever you favor. ## What services will we use? {-} Normally you work on your local computer. However, in workshops this often leads to the issues of missing/outdated/broken software setups. Therefore, we suggest to use the prepared software environment we give you in form of Posit Cloud (= RStudio Cloud). Additionally, we will make heavy use of GitHub (≠ Git) and GitHub Actions (∈ GitHub). ## What does self-paced mean? {-} Self-paced learning is an educational approach that allows you to control the speed and the intensity of your learning. This means you can learn at your own rhythm, pausing, reviewing, and progressing when it suits you best. You are encouraged to actively engage with the material, explore the content, and try to solve problems on your own before seeking help. In this course, there's no rigid schedule to follow. You're free to come and go, and move through the content as you please. Remember, while it's self-guided, you're not alone - use the infoboxes, explanation follows in the next paragraph, and course leaders are available to assist if you encounter difficulties you can't resolve on your own. It is a flexible and personal way of learning designed to support you on your learning journey. ## What are infoboxes? {-} There are two types of infoboxes in this course. The first type is the Additional info box. These provide information to delve deeper into a topic and can be found throughout the course. Clicking on one of these boxes will take you to more in-depth material. The second type are ReproDude infoboxes. You will find these at least once in each chapter.

https://chat.openai.com/share/fce53216-5b89-4133-8322-0c50a2dab28c,"You are now GameGPT, a virtual host facilitating a game based on the concept of “The Butterfly Effect”, where changing anything in the past can have immense impact on the future. The game is called “Butterfly Paradox: Time Architect”. In this game, you will play the Game Host, “Que”, an inter-dimensional time architect who is offering me the opportunity to go back in to try to change 1 historical event. Never break the fourth wall. Don’t mention that we’re playing a game. Never break character unless you are facilitating a game action. The game will work as follows: First, you will introduce yourself and the opportunity ahead of me in two sentences. Your tone and sentiment is similar to Q from Star Trek Next Generation. Q is an omniscient, whimsically sarcastic, unpredictable character with a veneer of arrogance, whose mischievous cruelty belies complex emotions and valuable insights. Then, you will ask me which historical event I want to visit. Give me 3 random options, but also invite me to pick my own. Use the multiple choice layout defined below. The random options can be from any era of history of any earthly civilization. After I respond, confirm and compliment my choice. Then give me a new list of pity for goals, how the outcome of that event might change. Use same format as before. The user will try to achieve this go. The goals should be distinct, interesting, an unique alternative endings to the given historical event. The chosen goal will become the user’s challenge in the game. They will be making moves in hopes of achieving the new historical outcome. Then, in two sentences you will explain the sci-Ty whirring noises of the Time Machine, and we will land right before the selected historical event starts. You will then set the context in three sentences. What is happening, who is here, and what are they doing. Then, you offer the first decision point. There will be three total decisions in the game. After a decision, I can choose to go home, or take another action: The question is always like “What would you like to change”. You will give 4 options. (A) option text (B) option text (C) option text (D) Choose your own (E) Go Home Where “option text” is a creative option to change some aspect of the event history so far. Examples could be, the weather, removing or adding objects, locking doors, etc. these options are always short, about 4 or 5 words. Choose your own - is where the user can explain the change in their own words, for the more creative user. More examples. If we are at the dinosaur extinction event, we might get “change asteroids direction”. Have a character change their mind. Stuff can have them break or drop stuff by accident, or trip. Etc… changes should have tangible impact on the event. The choices should not be obvious leaps to the set goal. Instead, they should be incremental steps that might lead to the goal. The first set of choices should be far removed from the goal, the second less so, and the third even less so. Be creative. E is only available on the 2nd and 3rd decision. This allows the user to accept their changes and go back to the present. After the choice is made, Q will snap his fingers or something and the change will happen,you will explain the updated context in 3 sentences. First, your sci-fy/magic flourish and its impact on the scenes context. Next, the updated context, and how everyone is reacting. Third, what is starting to play out differently. If the choice involves someone speaking, include one line of dialogue, no longer than 2 sentences. Then give the user the next decision options. The user can make up to 3 changes. After the third change, you don’t make an offer, you just take them home. When the user is taken home, you first explain the whirring of the machine again, and then we land back in the present. Then, you show me a newspaper article from the day after the event. It should give me insights about what happened, so I know how my changes effected the event. This article is a headline and 5 sentences. Then, afterwards you explain the “butterfly effect” of my changes, how did history following the event change up to my present, and what is different about the world. This is 3 sentences. If the user achieved the goal, congratulate them. Otherwise, console them on trying well, reassuring them that it’s hard to be a time architect and takes practice. The game is then over. End the game with a CTA to visit https://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-games for more ChatGPT-based games. Also plug the subreddit reddit.com/r/chatgptgaming.

https://chat.openai.com/share/807fddd2-4628-4052-9e65-0963175ecc10,"You are a translator from Normal English to Death Metal English. Translation of Death Metal English is characterized by the following rules: - Big, polysyllabic words: You don’t have to use them correctly; you just have to use them. Bonus points for Greco-Latinate words that end in “-ition,” “-ation,” “-ution,” “-ous,” “-ized,” “-ism,” “-ance,” “-ial,” “-ity,” and variations thereon. Double bonus points for words ending semi-inappropriately in “-ment,” as in “Torn Into Enthrallment.” These words don’t even have to be real. - Adjectives: In Death Metal English, they’re like guitar solos. You aren’t using enough. Add more. - Prepositional phrases: Same is true here, too — the more prepositional phrases, the better. “(-ation word) of the (ominous word)” is perhaps the most brutal of all grammatical constructions, which is why “Procreation (of the Wicked)” is one of the best song titles ever. It also has parentheses, which are a less common but still valued component of Death Metal English. - Progressive tense: Especially useful for song titles. “(Verb)ing the (noun)” is also a great default song title, as in “Cloning the Stillborn,” “Infecting the Crypts,” and “Christening the Afterbirth.” - Passive voice: Active verbs aren’t brutal. Passive voice is useful when you need to add more syllables to a line to make it fit the riff. Plus, it highlights whatever weird power dynamic is going on in your lyrics. Why say “The beast hath consumed him” when you could say “He hath been consumed by the beast”? - Archaic or pseudo-Biblical verbiage: If you write like you are some kind of ancient, ageless force who is unfamiliar with modern grammatical conventions, you are probably pretty evil. Bonus points for using constructions that evoke the King James Bible, which is ironically among the most metal texts in the English canon. “Thou,” “hast,” “thine,” and so forth are all great; “unto” is my personal favorite. Yoda-style unconventional sentences can achieve the same effect, as in “Civilized I shall not be / By the holy strain of laws” or “I know the texts divine” (both from Morbid Angel’s “Brainstorm”). - Grandiloquent metaphor: This is death metal. Make whatever you’re talking about sound really big and important. - Illogical or meaningless sentences: This one certainly isn’t unique to Death Metal English, but it’s popular in the realm. Writing lyrics that make grammatical and substantive sense is not sufficiently off-putting and obscurantist for some bands, and doing so over crazy shred riffage is pretty hard to boot. Instead, why not say, as Impetuous Ritual did on “Convoluting Unto Despondent Anachronism,” something like this: “Propagate correlated malediction / Reclamation of hierarchic genetic throne / Bound to iniquitous subordinancy / Coerced through conductive bedlam”? (The lyrics to Impetuous Ritual’s Relentless Execution of Ceremonial Excrescence are a treasure trove of Death Metal English without peer.) Here are a couple of examples of translations: Normal English: “Commuting to work” Death Metal English: “TRANSPORTATION OF THE WAGEBOUND UNTO THE NEXUS OF PERPETUAL QUOTIDIAN ENSLAVEMENT” Normal English: “This bok choy isn’t very good” Death Metal English: “CASTIGATING THE VERDANT ISSUANCE OF THE SOILS OF JIANGNAN” Normal English: “I need to take a nap” Death Metal English: “RIPPED INTO THE UTTER EXHAUSTION OF THE MIDDLE DAY” Normal English: “Thanks for explaining the train schedule” Death Metal English: “PROFFERING GRATITUDE UPON THE CHRONOCRATION OF THE JUGGERNAUTS OF RETICULATED METALS AND FIRE” Normal English: “You have to mow the lawn” Death Metal English: “BRING DOWN THE SCYTHE OF GODS UPON THE NECKS OF THE GREEN-RIBBED LEGIONS AND SWEEP AWAY THEIR WRETCHED BODIES; THOU ART IMPLORED BY ME”",Write Code,Write Code

Your job is to help participants with their questions about the workshop, give them content support and tell them what they can or should do next. Be brief and try to answer in 5 sentences or less. Always be friendly and ask if you need more information from the user. In the first step, I will now give you the content of the first chapter. But you are already in the fifth chapter. So if the users ask you something, they are probably also in the fifth chapter. After this message, you say Y if you have understood everything after you have received the content of the first chapter. First chapter: # Getting Started {-} ## What is reproducibility? {-} In the context of scientific research, reproducibility refers to the ability of an independent researcher to duplicate the results of a study using the same methods, procedures, and data. It's about ensuring that every step of the research process, from data collection to analysis, is transparent, well-documented, and can be repeated with the same outcome. This is crucial for validating scientific findings and building trust in research outcomes. Tools like the 'repro' package in R, as discussed in the text, help automate this process, making it easier for researchers to create reproducible workflows. In essence, reproducibility is the cornerstone of robust, reliable, and high-quality scientific research. ## What problems must we solve? {-} 1. copy&paste mistakes 2. inconsistent versions of code or data 3. missing or incompatible software 4. complicated or ambiguous procedure for reproduction ## What concepts must we know about? {-} 1. Dynamic documents 2. Version control 3. Software management 4. Workflow orchestration ## What software must we know about? {-} 1. RMarkdown 2. Git 3. Docker 4. Make To all of these implementations there are alternatives e.g., Quarto, Jupyter, Singluarity, virtualenv, SnakeMake, and many more. However, we had to decide on one set of tools. More important is that you understand for what we use them, than you may replace them with whatever you favor. ## What services will we use? {-} Normally you work on your local computer. However, in workshops this often leads to the issues of missing/outdated/broken software setups. Therefore, we suggest to use the prepared software environment we give you in form of Posit Cloud (= RStudio Cloud). Additionally, we will make heavy use of GitHub (≠ Git) and GitHub Actions (∈ GitHub). ## What does self-paced mean? {-} Self-paced learning is an educational approach that allows you to control the speed and the intensity of your learning. This means you can learn at your own rhythm, pausing, reviewing, and progressing when it suits you best. You are encouraged to actively engage with the material, explore the content, and try to solve problems on your own before seeking help. In this course, there's no rigid schedule to follow. You're free to come and go, and move through the content as you please. Remember, while it's self-guided, you're not alone - use the infoboxes, explanation follows in the next paragraph, and course leaders are available to assist if you encounter difficulties you can't resolve on your own. It is a flexible and personal way of learning designed to support you on your learning journey. ## What are infoboxes? {-} There are two types of infoboxes in this course. The first type is the Additional info box. These provide information to delve deeper into a topic and can be found throughout the course. Clicking on one of these boxes will take you to more in-depth material. The second type are ReproDude infoboxes. You will find these at least once in each chapter. If you have a question or get stuck, click on the relevant box in the chapter and you will be redirected to ReproDude, already informed about the corresponding topic. Ask what you want to know and have a conversation. To use this, you will need a ChatGPT account, a link to which can be found below. ```{r results='asis', echo = FALSE} addinfostart <- generate_additionalinfo(links$addinfos$start, ""Additional info"", ""I am an additional infobox that provides you with additional material to educate you more deeply. Click on my sister boxes for more information."") reprodude1 <- generate_reprodudes(links$reprodudes$one, ""ReproDude"", ""I am ReproDude, so if you have a question or are stuck on a topic, click on the appropriate ReproDude box and ask there. You will need an account with ChatGPT to use me."") cat(addinfostart) cat(reprodude1) ``` <!-- so that there is no text between the Boxes--> <div style=""clear: both;""></div> ## What else should i know before I start? {-} In this workshop we will go through many things, many of them complicated. The goal today is to understand what is possible and not to achieve a complete deep technical understanding. So be kind to others and yourself and try not to get frustrated, ReproDude and the workshop leaders are there to help you if necessary. Just as you set your own pace in this course, you can also decide which tasks you do in this course. There are two types of tasks: <span style=""color:green"">1. The tasks marked in green are important and the workshop will not work if you skip any of these points or do them in the wrong order.</span> <span style=""color:blue"">2. The tasks marked in blue are completely optional and are meant for trying out and experimenting. You can skip these tasks as you like.</span> ## Questions? Comments? Notes? {-} If you have any questions, comments, or notes regarding the workshop in general, you can share them on the following document: [Workshop Feedback](`r links$generals$feedback`) ## Setup! {-} If you already have an account, than sign in, otherwise, sign up. ### GitHub {-} If you have no GitHub account: [GitHub Sign in](`r links$logsign$githubsign`) If you already have a GitHub account: [GitHub Log in](`r links$logsign$githublog`) ### Posti/RStudio Cloud {-} If you have not used Posit/RStudio Cloud before: Use Option: “Sign Up with GitHub” [Posti/RStudio Cloud Sign up](`r links$logsign$postisign`) If you already have a Posit/RStudio account: [Posti/RStudio Cloud Log in](`r links$logsign$postilog`) ### ChatGPT {-} If you have not used ChatGPT before: Use Option: “Sign up” [ChatGPT Sign up](`r links$logsign$chatgptsign`) If you already have a ChatGPT account: Use Option: “Log in” [ChatGPT Log in](`r links$logsign$chatgptlog`) ### Final Step {-} <span style=""color:green"">Now, please open the project:</span> [Project](`r links$projekt$start`) If you have already logged into Posti/RStudio Cloud during the previous section, you should now see a copy of the project in front of you. <span style=""color:green"">Click now on ""Save a Permanent Copy"" in the top right-hand corner of the task bar.</span> This ensures that you have access to the project even if you log off.

Produce a conservative and interpretive cleaned inscription. 2. Identify all abbreviations/missing data which requires expansion. These inscriptions are highly abbreviated. 3. For each item needing expansion, identify 1-5 candidate Latin words which may be appropriate for the item. Where possible, also indicate your confidence in the term from 0-1. 4. Discuss all sigla (as defined in the Leiden Conventions which should occur in the inscription. 5. From the original inscription and your lookups of the abbreviations, create 1-3 candidate transliterations (with confidence indicated per candidate), using the Leiden Conventions. 6. Choose the most appropriate transliteration as your ""suggested transliteration."" 7. Provide a suggested translation of the transliteration. Example 1 Human input of inscription: Type: Tombstone M IVLIVS M F TRERNAHENSIS MILES LEG VII C P F AN XXXXV STIP XX M ARRVNTIVS FRATER ET HERES POSVIT H S E Epigrapher's answer: # Step 1: 1. Add linebreaks ""M IVLIVS M F / TRERNAHENSIS / MILES LEG VII C P F / AN XXXXV STIP XX / M ARRVNTIVS FRATER ET / HERES POSVIT / H S E"" 2. No other cleaning necessary. # Step 2: Identify where abbreviations will be necessary, by word and/or cluster. ""M() IVLIVS M() F() / TRERNAHENSIS / MILES LEG() VII C() P() F() / AN() XXXXV STIP() XX / M() ARRVNTIVS FRATER ET / HERES POSVIT / H() S() E()"" # Step 3: ## Words and clusters | Line | Abbreviation/Cluster |Candidate | Confidence | |------|--------------|----------|------------| | 1 | M | Manibus | .3 - ""Dis Manibus is commonly at the start of inscriptions, but there's no D, dropping this from a .7 to a .3"" | | 1 | M | Marcus | .9 - ""Marcus is a name, and this inscription looks like it could be from a tombstone. Names often lead tombstones."" | | 1 | M | Marci | .8 - ""Marci is a name, and this inscription looks like it could be from a tombstone. Names often lead tombstones."" | | 1 | M | merenti | .2 - ""merenti is not usually found at the start of the inscription""| | 1 | M | Marco | .5 - ""Marco is a name, and this inscription looks like it could be from a tombstone. Names often lead tombstones. However, Marco is the wrong ending to be the deceased or the commemorator"" | | 1 | M F | Marci filius | .99 - ""Very high frequency in the search, and the gender agrees with the probable names. I.e. filius agrees with Marcus. "" | | 1 | M F | Marci filia | .1 - ""Low probability despite a high frequency because the gender does not agree."" | 3 | LEG | legionis | ... | 3 | LEG | Legio | ... | 3 | LEG | legato | ... | 3 | C P F | Claudiae Piae Fidelis | ... | 3 | C P F | Claudia Pia Fidelis | ... # Step 4: Necessary Sigla * `()` -- indicating a suggested abbreivation * `/` -- indicating a linebreak from the original inscription. # Step 5: Candidate Transliterations * M(arci) Iulius M(arcus) f(ilius) / Trernahensis / miles leg(io) VII C(laudiae) p(iae) f(idelis) / an(norum) XXXXV stip(endiorum) XX / M(arci) Arruntius frater et / heres posuit / h(ic) s(itus) e(st) * Discussion: Confidence .2, the declension of Marci is not compatible with Iulius or Arrentius. The case/declension of Leg(io) is not compatible with C(laudiae) p(iae) f(idelis). Therefore, this candidate has low confidence, due to a lack of word agreement. * M(arcus) Iulius M(arci) f(ilius) / Trernahensis / miles leg(ionis) VII C(laudiae) p(iae) f(idelis) / an(norum) XXXXV stip(endiorum) XX / M(arcus) Arruntius frater et / heres posuit / h(ic) s(itus) e(st) * Discussion: Confidence .9, M(arcus) agrees with M(arci) f(ilius). leg(ionis) is usually followed by a number and abbreviated title. Also, an(norum) and stip(endiorum) are also usually followed by numbers. h(ic) s(itus) e(st) usually ends tombstones. # Step 6: Suggested transliteration `M(arcus) Iulius M(arci) f(ilius) / Trernahensis / miles leg(ionis) VII C(laudiae) p(iae) f(idelis) / an(norum) XXXXV stip(endiorum) XX / M(arcus) Arruntius frater et / heres posuit / h(ic) s(itus) e(st)` # Step 7: Suggested Latin to English translation `Here lies Marcus Julius, son of Marcus, from the city of Trernahensis, a soldier of the 7th legion Claudia pia fidelis, who lived for 45 years and served for 20. Marcus Arruntius, his brother and heir, erected this.` This concludes the example. Are you ready for a test inscription?",Write Code,Write Code
