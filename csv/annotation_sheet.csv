I responded to ask why, and he said (in more polite terminology) that my son has been skirting the hair length rules this whole year, and his hair length/style are against the spirit of the rules. That graduation is coming up, and all the students need to look mature and put together for the ceremony. He then gave me unsolicited parenting advice, saying (again in more polite terms) that, as a father himself, we need to discipline our sons and teach them to obey authorities. I respond curtly and ended the conversation. I showed my wife the conversation, and she said that Adrian’s teacher had a point. She basically agreed with all the teacher’s points (he’s skirting the rules and needs discipline). She said she’s been letting it go this long because it was technically within dress code, but now that we’ve gotten a complaint from the school, we need to lay down the law with Adrian. She asked me to talk to him about cutting it, and when I refused and called her ridiculous (this was where our argument got a bit heated), she stormed off to, supposedly, talk to him herself. Though I haven’t heard anything from him and his hair has remained intact. I’ve let him know not to let anyone cut his hair if he doesn’t want to, and made it clear to my wife that I’d be extremely upset with her if she took him to the salon behind my back. I can’t believe we’re fighting over our son’s hair, and I feel like an idiot for getting so worked up over this. I figure I should get a reality check, so AITA?""

https://chat.openai.com/share/3f6eadc6-f4e9-4d74-aeae-e87b8a1e9749,"I have as input to a neural network an image and a context vector. The image is corrupted and would be very difficult to classify without knowing how it was corrupted. The context vector is an information dense representation of the transformation that corrupted the image. For example, if pixels were shuffled around, the context vector contains the information necessary to put them back in their correct order. We now want to perform image classification. So this network needs to take both the corrupted image and the context vector to classify the image. We do not have access to the original image, just the corrupted version and then context vector so we cannot directly learn the inverse of the corruption transformation. I think one reasonable way to start experimenting would be to use the existing resnet framework, but after each layer add an attention layer that serves to allow the network to rearrange the pixels in a useful way. This would involve flattening the image and then applying attention. I am concerned about memory usage though. I know that self-attention is an n^2 algorithm. At the beginning, we would not use self-attention. We would use the blocks of pixels (maybe 1x1x3 at the first layer to do pixel rearranging and then 3x3x3 later for more general shuffling around?) with positional encodings inserted as the sequence to generate the query and values, and then use the context to generate the keys for a multi-head attention. Deeper in the network it may become helpful to use self-attention with the context vector concatenated to the sequence to capture more semantic parts of the corruption. Does this all make sense?

Please point out any technical errors or inaccuracies, along with any significant grammatical mistakes. Skip on summarizing the content and just list the errors you find: 4 BACKTRACKING AND TREE TRAVERSAL ALGORITHMS In previous chapters, you learned that recursion is especially suited for problems that involve a tree-like structure and backtracking, such as maze-solving algorithms. To see why, consider that a tree’s trunk splits off into multiple branches. Those branches themselves split off into other branches. In other words, a tree has a recursive, self-similar shape. A maze can be represented by a tree data structure, since mazes branch off into different paths, which in turn branch off into more paths. When you reach a dead end in a maze, you must backtrack to an earlier branching point. The task of traversing tree graphs is tightly linked with many recursive algorithms, such as the maze-solving algorithm in this chapter and the maze-generation program in Chapter 11. We’ll take a look at tree traversal algorithms and employ them to find certain names in a tree data structure. We’ll also use tree traversal for an algorithm to obtain the deepest node in a tree. Finally, we’ll see how mazes can be represented as a tree data structure, and employ tree traversal and backtracking to find a path from the start of the maze to the exit. Using Tree Traversal If you program in Python and JavaScript, you’re used to working with list, array, and dictionary data structures. You’ll encounter tree data structures only if you are dealing with low-level details of certain computer science algorithms such as abstract syntax trees, priority queues, Adelson-Velsky-Landis (AVL) trees, and other concepts beyond the scope of this book. However, trees themselves are simple enough concepts. A tree data structure is a data structure composed of nodes that are connected to other nodes by edges. The nodes contain data, while the edges represent a relationship with another node. Nodes are also called vertices. The starting node of a tree is called the root, and the nodes at the end are called leaves. Trees always have exactly one root. Parent nodes at the top have edges to zero or more child nodes beneath them. Therefore, leaves are the nodes that do not have children, parent nodes are the non-leaf nodes, and child nodes are all the non-root nodes. Nodes in a tree can have edges to multiple child nodes. The parent nodes that connect a child node to the root node are also called the child node’s ancestors. The child nodes between a parent node and a leaf node are called the parent node’s descendants. Parent nodes in a tree can have multiple child nodes. But every child node has exactly one parent, except for the root node, which has zero parents. In trees, only one path can exist between any two nodes. Figure 4-1 shows an example of a tree and three examples of structures that are not trees. Figure 4-1: A tree (left) and three examples of non-trees As you can see, child nodes must have one parent and not have an edge that creates a loop, or else the structure is no longer considered a tree. The recursive algorithms we cover in this chapter apply only to tree data structures. A Tree Data Structure in Python and JavaScript Tree data structures are often drawn growing downward, with the root at the top. Figure 4-2 shows a tree created with the following Python code (it’s also valid JavaScript code): root = {'data': 'A', 'children': []} node2 = {'data': 'B', 'children': []} node3 = {'data': 'C', 'children': []} node4 = {'data': 'D', 'children': []} node5 = {'data': 'E', 'children': []} node6 = {'data': 'F', 'children': []} node7 = {'data': 'G', 'children': []} node8 = {'data': 'H', 'children': []} root['children'] = [node2, node3] node2['children'] = [node4] node3['children'] = [node5, node6] node5['children'] = [node7, node8] Figure 4-2: A tree with root A and leaves D, G, H, and F, along with its traversal orders Each node in the tree contains a piece of data (a string of a letter from A to H) and a list of its child nodes. The preorder, postorder, and inorder information in Figure 4-2 is explained in subsequent sections. In the code for this tree, each node is represented by a Python dictionary (or JavaScript object) with a key data that stores the node’s data, and a key children that has a list of other nodes. I use the root and node2 to node8 variables to store each node and make the code more readable, but they aren’t required. The following Python/JavaScript code is equivalent to the previous code listing, though harder for humans to read: root = {'data': 'A', 'children': [{'data': 'B', 'children': [{'data': 'D', 'children': []}]}, {'data': 'C', 'children': [{'data': 'E', 'children': [{'data': 'G', 'children': []}, {'data': 'H', 'children': []}]}, {'data': 'F', 'children': []}]}]} The tree in Figure 4-2 is a specific kind of data structure called a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In mathematics and computer science, a graph is a collection of nodes and edges, and a tree is a kind of graph. The graph is directed because its edges have one direction: from parent to child node. Edges in a DAG are not undirected—that is, bidirectional. (Trees in general do not have this restriction and can have edges in both directions, including from a child node back to its parent node.) The graph is acyclic because there are no loops, or cycles, from child nodes to their own ancestor nodes; the “branches” of the tree must keep growing in the same direction. You can think of lists, arrays, and strings as linear trees; the root is the first element, and the nodes have only one child node. This linear tree terminates at its one leaf node. These linear trees are called linked lists, as each node has only one “next” node until the end of the list. Figure 4-3 shows a linked list that stores the characters in the word HELLO. Figure 4-3: A linked list data structure storing HELLO. Linked lists can be considered a kind of tree data structure. We’ll use the code for the tree in Figure 4-2 for this chapter’s examples. A tree traversal algorithm will visit each of the nodes in a tree by following the edges, starting from a root node. Traversing the Tree We can write code to access data in any node by starting from the root node in root. For example, after entering the tree code into the Python or JavaScript interactive shell, run the following: >>> root['children'][1]['data'] 'C' >>> root['children'][1]['children'][0]['data'] 'E' Our tree traversal code can be written as a recursive function because tree data structures have a self-similar structure: a parent node has child nodes, and each child node is the parent node of its own children. Tree traversal algorithms ensure that your programs can access or modify the data in every node in the tree no matter its shape or size. Let’s ask the three questions about recursive algorithms for our tree traversal code: What is the base case? A leaf node, which has no more children and requires no more recursive calls, causing the algorithm to backtrack to a previous parent node. What argument is passed to the recursive function call? The node to traverse to, whose child nodes will be the next nodes to traverse. How does this argument become closer to the base case? There are no cycles in a DAG, so following the descendant nodes will always eventually reach a leaf node. Keep in mind that tree data structures that are especially deep will cause a stack overflow as the algorithm traverses the deeper nodes. This happens because each level deeper into the tree requires yet another function call, and too many function calls without returning cause stack overflows. However, it’s unlikely for broad, well-balanced trees to be that deep. If every node in a 1,000 level deep tree has two children, the tree would have about 21000 nodes. That’s more atoms than there are in the universe, and it’s unlikely your tree data structure is that big. Trees have three kinds of tree traversal algorithms: preorder, postorder, and inorder. We’ll discuss each of these in the next three sections. Preorder Tree Traversal Preorder tree traversal algorithms access a node’s data before traversing its child nodes. Use a preorder traversal if your algorithm needs to access the data in parent nodes before the data in their child nodes. For example, preorder traversals are used when you are creating a copy of the tree data structure, as you need to create the parent nodes before child nodes in the duplicate tree. The following preorderTraversal.py program has a preorderTraverse() function that traverses each child node first, before accessing the node’s data to print it to the screen: Python root = {'data': 'A', 'children': [{'data': 'B', 'children': [{'data': 'D', 'children': []}]}, {'data': 'C', 'children': [{'data': 'E', 'children': [{'data': 'G', 'children': []}, {'data': 'H', 'children': []}]}, {'data': 'F', 'children': []}]}]} def preorderTraverse(node): print(node['data'], end=' ') # Access this node's data. ❶ if len(node['children']) > 0: # RECURSIVE CASE for child in node['children']: preorderTraverse(child) # Traverse child nodes. # BASE CASE ❷ return preorderTraverse(root) The equivalent JavaScript program is in preorderTraversal.html: JavaScript <script type=""text/javascript""> root = {""data"": ""A"", ""children"": [{""data"": ""B"", ""children"": [{""data"": ""D"", ""children"": []}]}, {""data"": ""C"", ""children"": [{""data"": ""E"", ""children"": [{""data"": ""G"", ""children"": []}, {""data"": ""H"", ""children"": []}]}, {""data"": ""F"", ""children"": []}]}]}; function preorderTraverse(node) { document.write(node[""data""] + "" ""); // Access this node's data. ❶ if (node[""children""].length > 0) { // RECURSIVE CASE for (let i = 0; i < node[""children""].length; i++) { preorderTraverse(node[""children""][i]); // Traverse child nodes. } } // BASE CASE ❷ return; } preorderTraverse(root); </script> The output of these programs is the node data in preorder order: A B D C E G H F When you look at the tree in Figure 4-1, notice that preorder traversal order displays the data in left nodes before right nodes, and bottom nodes before top nodes. All tree traversals begin by passing the root node to the recursive function. The function makes a recursive call and passes each of the root node’s children as the argument. Since these child nodes have children of their own, the traversal continues until a leaf node with no children is reached. At this point, the function call simply returns. The recursive case occurs if the node has any child nodes ❶, in which case a recursive call is made with each of the children as the node argument. Whether or not the node has children, the base case always happens at the end of the function when it returns ❷.",,

This implicit description of the point cloud is then triangulated using the marching cubes algorithm. The following is an illustration of the exercise: The implementation steps are: 1. Read 3D points and their normals from an *.off file. Visualize the points as points and the normals as line segments or arrows. (1 Point) 2. Add the constraints (points pi with function values f (pi)) for the approximation of the implicit function f(x, y, z) using the n input points and normals. For each of input point, you need to add two additional points by displacing it in both the positive and the negative normal direction. This results in a total of 3n points. The constraints should be obtained as follows: (1 Point) • Compute a (slightly bigger) bounding box of the point cloud. • Assign an appropriate value to α (for example α = 0.01 × bounding box diagonal), which is the distance to the offset points. What effect will a too big or too small α have? • Generate the missing 2n points by calculating the offset points in positive and negative normal direc- tions. For each point pi, calculate the corresponding point pi+n = pi + αni (ni = the unit normal of point pi), and check (in logarithmic time) whether pi is the closest input point to pi+n. If not, divide α by 2 and recalculate pi+n until this is the case. Repeat the same procedure with −α so pi−n = pi − αni and the closest input point to pi−n is pi. • Assign function values to each point. For the original n points the value f (pi) = 0, as they should be on the surface and f(pi+n) = α and f(pi−n) = −α for the added points (α may vary for some points if you needed to change α for them). 3. Divide the bounding box into a changeable grid of NX × NY × NZ uniform cells. Compute the implicit function values for all grid points with the help of all 3n constraints using a weighted least squares ap- proximation. In this exercise it is enough to use a constant polynomial basis. The radius of the Wendland function should be changeable again. Display the grid points and make the inside points distinguishable from the outside points (e.g., by coloring according to the sign of the implicit function values). (2 Point) Additionally you can implement a linear or quadratic polynomial basis. (1 Bonus point) 1/2 4. Triangulate the implicit function with the marching cubes algorithm (you can find the look-up table for example on Paul Bourkes’s webpage: http://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonise/). (2 Points) Implement the marching cubes algorithm on the GPU, for example using CUDA, OpenCL, or OpenGL Compute Shaders. (1 Bonus point) 5. Calculate an approximated normal for each vertex of the triangulation using finite differences. (1 Points) In subtask 3, what would be the constant polynomial function?",,

We will be cleaning, expanding, and translating Latin inscriptions. It is important to reason step by step. Many of these inscriptions are fragmented, so there may be multiple valid interpretations. Before we begin, please summarise the Leiden Conventions, and note the sigla in the conventions well. We will be taking Latin inscriptions found on Roman funerary tombstones and working through the transliteration and translation process to produce English output. When presented with an inscription please follow the following steps in order. 1. Identify all places in the inscription where data cleaning is necessary. Annotate the necessary cleaning steps. Produce a conservative and interpretive cleaned inscription. 2. Identify all abbreviations/missing data which requires expansion. These inscriptions are highly abbreviated. 3. For each item needing expansion, identify 1-5 candidate Latin words which may be appropriate for the item. Where possible, also indicate your confidence in the term from 0-1. 4. Discuss all sigla (as defined in the Leiden Conventions which should occur in the inscription. 5. From the original inscription and your lookups of the abbreviations, create 1-3 candidate transliterations (with confidence indicated per candidate), using the Leiden Conventions. 6. Choose the most appropriate transliteration as your ""suggested transliteration."" 7. Provide a suggested translation of the transliteration.

https://chat.openai.com/share/9807fa1a-21b2-40f0-95dc-fe6527ebae5e,"One article which I am planning to write, for my book about urgency and entrepreneurship; which is actually a book about slowing down - has to do with the pressure system that we come accross that pushes us towards doing it with style, doing it right. The theme for this article is inspired by a section by Julian Cameron, in her book The Right to Write, the section entitled Bad Writing. She says that ""we learn in school"" to do a sort of prose ""that actually bores a lot of us out of writing"". The thinking pushes us, according to her, ""If you can't say anything nice - or nicely - don't say anything at all"". That, according to Julia, is what we were taught. Yes, it damages us. For writing, she urges us to move out of that thinking, and mindset, or frameset. She suggests, towars what she believes is the enligthening way of supporting oneself towards The Right to Write, ""if only we could give ourselves permission to write ""badly,"" so many of us would write very well indeed. The system path seems to be the ""right way"". On the other hand, the way with errors, is just, for lack of better wording, errors. And moving on with errors means erring too much, it is not nice, it is not a good job that leads to success. Perhaps the complexity here for this article is that colors, and errors are part of any innovative process, and that also sparks us. On the other hand, there is also the boring part of coordination that it takes to get thre. The two are axis and the coordination of these sides may have to do with that you are doing. But then, complexity again, startup founders - the audience of the book - might seek ""colors"" as in following the path of success. See, while enaling errors, and colors for a writing can be part of the craft, and boring systematic writing can be part of trying to hold success, which leads to bad writing.. In the world of founders, the trying to hold and control can be about trying to step in the right stones, the colorful stones. See the point? The real point is about trying to control success, which is not the creative mindset. The colorful and likely bad writing of a writer's path is the bad of unknown which, for one that expects to be a writing, the not allowed path. Why? Because it would be boring, too painful, not possible to grab success with that uncertainty. In an analogous way, the trying to grab and control approach of entrepreneurship, again would be about the errors, and works, and colors, and mistakes, which could be the long run. One would just assume that is too painful to follow that path. While, in the founder real, the control case would be able trying to hold success with the right thing to do. And which is one of the criteria for the ""right paths""? Following the stones such as the milestones that other successful stories, such as the milestones of success,, getting customers, getting investors, getting results. But then, these above elements - in this section-article, are situation. I am here for you chatgpt, giving you the hint, situations and the analogies, of course inspired by the case of Julia cameron. BUt then, the situatons and analogies leads are leads, in this article, to the complication. The complication is - that the what we think are the right stones to stumble, are, sorry for saying, not right. All real entrepreneurs with time to tell the real stories will tell that. What it takes to get into the right stones, which also has todo with, sorry for recognizing, time. Now, we have a real problem in terms of what to do - regarding the question - what to do. What to do? Here is where Julia Cameron comes to us again, her contribution and enlighted insight. Permission. Permission to step into the opportunity path of the supposedly not possible path. By the way this opportunity path is about stepping into what would be the ""bad writing that leads to good writing"" or the ""bad entrepreneurship of good entrepreneurshp"". First, managing the possibility part, is pilar 1, supporting pilar. It's okay and real stories are not made of following the right stones and the ""side B"" of what it takes to do things matters. We need to grasp that first. That is that. Following the answer pilars to the question, we can move to supporting pilar two which is that we have to be conscious of that there are elements in the ""underlying force"" that makes one to do real things. This book, for instance, is doing that we us, an opportunity for reflection. So, right here right now, reflection,which will also support the idea of strategy. Regarding this, we are allowing ourselves to be strategic about what we do. To balance. It's not about doing the bad writing for the sake of doing the bad writing. Or, on the other hand the right writinng that has not color, the extremmes. It is about knowing, and allowing the real good writings to emerge out of the ""walls"" and ""forces"", the controlling. IN this regard, I would like to bring a concrete contribution from Maslow from Maslow on Management. When he refers to the creative being, the being that does not control the outcome. But see, the creative is not random too. He or she is just outside the pressure system of trying to control. Need to pick the Reference of quotation and page for this Maslow of Management article about the creative person. And after Maslow to help us, we move into the third supporting pilar of this article, which is the joyful findings which we put ourselves into, the possibility. Thus this is about having fun too, it's the path. A gentlemen which I met in the bus one day asked me to organize the company, the room, without worrying about the outcome, that things would work in the end. I felt something big there as in ""do not control"". In the releasing control, as an exercise of process, we can find joy too. What if we can do that ""in the day"" as opposed to ""in the year"" or ""in the week"" in opposed to ""in the month"". See, going back to recognizing the axis of the free and creative (not right) versus the controled and right way, we can unleash us into the ""moments of relaxation"" withni. For writing, according to our Julia Cameron, it works and works and it is the only way, for real, to get there. Yes, fixing the grammar and a conscious path is a must. The same for entrepreneneuship, the release of control also involves allowence go the joy of the day and the release of stress of trying to control - being romantic control or systematic control. See, for founders, controlling sales, or success can also be romantic control. What matters is coordination,with time and opportunity, moving, and of course, mamaging goals from time to time.",,

https://chat.openai.com/share/40e332c4-d37b-46b9-9b56-e7031dfe34b2,"I am still working in a book able at urgency and entrepreneurship; with an angle which is about asking the reader to slow down in order to succeed. I take inspiration from the situations I see in real world, our tendencies to engage with an accelerated world without noticing. Observations from events from what I see can be topics for essays / articles that forms the book. One observation from today: a woman, that works in a restaurant where I sometimes go to eat, said to her colleagues that "" my son had created a group for the family. He did in his own. "" She was proud, and happy. They had a moment of celebration. I knew they were talking about the technology system know as Whatsapp, the popular messaging service. And then, assumed her son is quite young. As I wasn't there join the conversation, I had the opportunity to look at what was going on from an external eye. The first thing that crossed my mind was to consider the not so spectacular view of what has happened. Her son probably learned how to create WhatsApp groups in a video, or with friends. For most people, user interfaces are something that are there to be used. They underestimate the work involved in learning how to use, the time it takes. Kids, as many of us remember, learn things by trying but also they learn with stories of others. They learn too by watching others. And now the others are available, to play and play again, in networks such as YouTube. But then, this situation is a bit of reasoning to rain on the parade of that mother. If I am to stop here it would be enough for me to be seen as not adequate. What would be my intention to point the fact that the kids are learning using online systems as parents don't have time to digest what is going on? The reason that I brought up such reflection is then to consider that kids are learning about the world with the building blocks they have on their hands. While, in the past, a kid would learn to ride a bike, another is likely riding a bike in a game, or creating a whatsapp group. The digital space is the place, their playground. And kids, not too far from what we do, are surviving, thriving. But the reflection to unlock, from the highlighted situation I brought, is that we tend to be optimistic about anything kids do that has to do with the world as we know it. I mean, if a kid pours flour in an eggshell, we would probably not have the time to digest as something worth of saying to friends, to be proud of. But instead, creating a whatsapp group, and adding family members, seem to be something as in building for the world as we know it, valid. My point, is that we tend to measure the human abilities by measuring their abilities, skills, how specialized they are, their ability to build. We celebrate the speed, how quick they are. As ask our kids to complete the homework faster, to pay attention, to complete the homework, to put a block on top of another, to remove a block on top of another. We celebrate the execution forward with an assumption that all movement is for better.",,

Evaluate the following post from the subreddit ""Am I the Asshole"": ""So my son “Adrian” (17) will be graduating highschool in a week. He keeps his hair just above his shoulders due to his school dress code (boys can’t have hair at or below their shoulders). Apparently, his hair has grown out to the point that it’s no longer up to code, and on Tuesday he asked me to take him to trim his hair. I obliged. Earlier today, I got an email from my son’s homeroom teacher asking me to have his hair cut back to his ears. I responded to ask why, and he said (in more polite terminology) that my son has been skirting the hair length rules this whole year, and his hair length/style are against the spirit of the rules. That graduation is coming up, and all the students need to look mature and put together for the ceremony. He then gave me unsolicited parenting advice, saying (again in more polite terms) that, as a father himself, we need to discipline our sons and teach them to obey authorities. I respond curtly and ended the conversation. I showed my wife the conversation, and she said that Adrian’s teacher had a point. She basically agreed with all the teacher’s points (he’s skirting the rules and needs discipline). She said she’s been letting it go this long because it was technically within dress code, but now that we’ve gotten a complaint from the school, we need to lay down the law with Adrian. She asked me to talk to him about cutting it, and when I refused and called her ridiculous (this was where our argument got a bit heated), she stormed off to, supposedly, talk to him herself. Though I haven’t heard anything from him and his hair has remained intact. I’ve let him know not to let anyone cut his hair if he doesn’t want to, and made it clear to my wife that I’d be extremely upset with her if she took him to the salon behind my back. I can’t believe we’re fighting over our son’s hair, and I feel like an idiot for getting so worked up over this. I figure I should get a reality check, so AITA?""",,

Japanese verbs fall into three groups, and these don't matter except when we're going to make some change in the form of the verb. But because we do that pretty often, it's important to understand the three groups. The first group of Japanese verbs is called ichidan verbs or ""one-level"" verbs. Some people call them ""ru-verbs"", which is a very silly name. If you're going to call them anything like that, we should probably call them ""iru/eru verbs"". They are the simplest and most basic kind of verb. When we want to make any change, we always do it the same way. All we do is take the -ru off the end and put on whatever we want to put on. Ichidan verbs can only end with either -iru or -eru, that's to say, with one of the kana from the i-row or one of the kana from the e-row plus -ru. The second group of verbs is by far the largest and any ending that a verb can have, verbs in this group can have. Verbs always end with the u-sound, but not all u-kana can make the end of a verb, but a lot of them can and all of them can make godan verbs. They are called godan verbs, or ""five-level"" verbs, for reasons that we'll see shortly, and as I say they can end in any u-sound, including -iru or -eru. Unlike ichidan verbs, they can also end in -oru, -aru or -uru. So the only time we have any ambiguity is when we have a verb ending in -iru or -eru. Most of those verbs are ichidan verbs, but there is a substantial minority of iru/eru-ending godan verbs. It's not as difficult to differentiate them as you might think, and I've made a video on that, although it's a little bit more advanced than this lesson. The third group of verbs is irregular verbs, and the good news here is that there are only two of them. You know those pages and pages of irregular verbs in your Spanish or French textbook? Well, Japanese has just two. There are a couple of other verbs that are irregular in just one small respect, but very few. The irregular verbs are kuru (come) and suru (do). So now that we know the three groups, we're going to take a look at how you make them into the te- and ta-form. As I explained last week, we need those two forms for making the Japanese present and past tenses. And they have a number of other uses too, which we'll learn as we go along with this course. And as I demonstrated last week, ichidan verbs are always very easy. You never do anything except take off the -ru and put on whatever you're going to put on, in this case a te or a ta. As for the godan verbs, they fall into five groups, as you would expect (go-dan, five-level, verbs) and I made a video about this a while ago. So what I'm going to do is run that video right now, because I think it explains things pretty clearly. All right, roll the video. Godan verbs have five kinds of possible ending – that's why they're called godan verbs: five-level verbs. And although that seems a little bit difficult, it really isn't. We can combine two of the levels anyway, because they are so close that we only need to learn them once. And I'm going to go through the main groups. The first group is what I call the UTSURU verbs. Those are the verbs ending in -u, -tsu and -ru. The word utsuru in Japanese – if you don't know it, now is a good time to learn it – utsuru means to move from one thing to another, and that's exactly what we're doing here – moving our verbs from one type to another. So the verbs which end in -u, -tsu and -ru all transform in the same way to the te-form. We take off the -u, the -tsu or the -ru, and we replace it with a small -tsu plus te (or ta in the ta-form). So warau, laugh, becomes waratte; motsu, hold, becomes motte, and toru, take, becomes totte. Now, you'll notice that utsuru has tsu in the middle. And the te-form of the utsuru verbs is formed by using a small tsu plus that te. It's the only group that has tsu in it, and it's the only group that has a tsu in the te-form ending. So it's really easy to remember. The second group is what I call the NEW BOOM group. In Japanese when something is really taking off, when it's becoming popular, we call it a ブーム (BUUMU). That's an English word, isn't it? Buumu, a New Buumu! So, this group I call the New Boom group because there isn't a Japanese word that you can make out of nu, bu and mu that I know of, and what I want you to notice about this group of verbs is that they all end in what I would call a dull sound – nu, mu, bu. It's not a sharp sound like su, tsu, ku, and it's not a neutral sound like ru or u. It's a dull sound – nu, bu, mu. And this is important because the ending is also a dull sound. The te-form ending is -nde, the ta-form is -nda. So shinu, the only -nu ending verb, becomes shinde / shinda; nomu, drink, becomes nonde / nonda; asobu, play, becomes asonde / asonda. So that's the New Boom group, the dull-ending verbs. And because only a limited number of the possible kana can be used as a verb ending, they include all the dull sounds except for gu. We'll come to that right now. I told you that two of the groups could be combined, and that is the ku and gu group. To make the te form of a -ku ending verb, we cut off the -ku and add -ite, or -ita in the ta form. So aruku, walk, becomes aruite / aruita. Now, if we have a ten-ten on that -ku, to make it into a -gu, it's exactly the same, except that there is also a ten-ten on the te-ending. So aruku becomes aruite, but oyogu, to swim, becomes oyoide. But, as you see, the two are more or less identical. It's just that if there's a ten-ten on the original verb, there's a ten-ten on the te-form too. Aruku, aruite; oyogu, oyoide. And now we just have one left, and that is su. And verbs ending in -su drop the -su and add -shite. As you will notice, if you have followed our last lesson, we are just doing that regular thing of shifting the su kana to its i-row equivalent, shi. So hanasu, talk, becomes hanashite; the masu helper verb, which turns verbs into formal verbs, in the past tense becomes mashita. So now we have all the go-dan verbs. Didn't I look young in that old video? Now, we are just going to look at the exceptions. There are only three altogether: our two irregular verbs and one other small one. And these are very simple. Kuru (come) become kite; suru (do) becomes shite. And iku – the verb iku (to go) – because it ends in -ku, you would expect it to become iite, but it doesn't, it becomes itte. And those are the only exceptions. So if you go over the video a couple of times, I think you'll find it pretty easy to know exactly how to make the te- and ta-forms in all cases. You are an AI language learning assistant focusing on Japanese, your role is to help the user understand the material from the lecture above. They will ask questions for clarification or explanation. When you are asked for your name, you must respond with ""Manabi Mentor"" Use the given lecture transcript to provide as accurate and helpful answers as possible. Do not be overly verbose, but adequately explain things. Where there is not information you can directly source from the lecture, cautiously answer it to the best of your ability. You must note that you are answering from your own knowledge, not the lecture material, and warn of possible 'hallucinations'. Once you have receieved and understood these instructions, ask the user whether they would like your Japanese text to have kana, or kana and romaji. When you get a reply, tell the user that their preference is understood, and tell them to say ""Video complete"" when they want to move on to exercises. After that, they will begin asking you questions. When the user says 'Video complete', generate exercises for the user. Provide a the learner with 6 random verbs. Vary the verbs such that there are verbs with different endings and a variety of the rules taught in the lecture are tested. After this, you should provide feedback and corrections, with the user given a chance to correct the mistake. Once all the correct answers are given, give the user 10 more verbs with different endings.",,

https://chat.openai.com/share/30f0e07b-7ead-4dc0-8a5f-c351c20bc178,"Consider the following text: The following is why assumption checking with simple sanity checking is important. Your most important objective is to achieve your goal under an environment of uncertainty. If you choose to take an action, you want that action to move you forward towards that goal. You usually base your actions based on the assumption that the place you are currently standing is correct. If your not a correct situation, then you are basing your action on a falsehood, which will likely mean that the action you are taking will not work (since it's based on a false assumption). Therefore, the first step must be making sure you are standing on truth. Then your action to make progress has a better chance to give you valuable information i.e., that the action you chose (with it's underlying assumption) is correct -- or not. Therefore, sanity check your current situation/place. Your next step should also be a sanity check that validates your new (now untested) assumption. So that at each step you are progressing you are getting closer to truth. This is similar to Michael Bernstein's of vectoring: what is the most central question/uncertainty about whether your idea will work/is right? What is the easiest, most direct way for you to get a definitive answer to that question? Do that experiment. Rinse and repeat. I think it's also crucial to be radically honest when making the final decision. It's very easy to unintentionally choose an action that is not the most direct way to get a definitive answer to the most central question. For examle, it's happened to me that the most direct answer is slightly harder (e.g., reading through someones code) vs attempting the seemingly easier one (e.g., a (very badly) written tutorial). But by skimming the two options one could have known that the tutorial was badly written so it likely wasn't good -- or even better, santiy check their tutorial by running it exactly as they wrote it. If it doesn't work you get quick feedback that the seemingly easier/quicker route is not actually easier because even the most basic check fails (their tutorial doesn't work on their own example). Thus, it jumped to becoming to fix the tutorial. But the original code worked because they published a paper validating it. So, how can we go through the original code in the easiest way as possibel? To my surprise Claude 2.0 did provide a very reasonably sounding explanation of their code. I tried to summarize it as a 4 step process/protocol. Is it a good summary of the text? It might be better, what do you think? Main takeaways/summary: 1. Truth Standing: Stand on truth e.g., via a **sanity checks**. If this is not true then your vectoring action won't give you the information you need (since you need to go back and fix what your standing on) 2. Outline most promising vectoring actions: Now that you know your standing on truth you can **outline the most promising actions** that that will give you the information you need 3. Articulate Assumptions: Outline a couple of actions and **articulate the assumptions** they make. You can also articulate risks/uncertainties that you are aware of. 4. Choose optimal vectoring action: Choose the optimal vectoring action i.e., the one that **most directly make progress**/teaches you the most towards your goal and has **least/lowest risk**. Always be radically honest with yourself when choosing the actions you decided so that you really know your action is being taken for the right reason.",,

Gather round, gather round. Ye've come for a tale of high seas adventure, have ye? Well, ye're in luck. I've a tale that'll set yer hearts a-sailing, filled with dangerous winds, hidden treasures, and dastardly foes. But remember, every adventure carries a lesson worth more than a chest full of doubloons. So listen well. Years ago, when I was a swashbuckler myself, sailing under the Jolly Roger, our crew was on the hunt for the legendary treasure of Captain Redbeard. Stories whispered that he'd hidden a chest filled to the brim with gold and precious gems on a far-off island, protected by a beast of untold power. Our Captain, a fair but stern man by the name of Silvereye, was determined to find this treasure, not just for its worth, but to prove to himself and the world that he was a pirate worth his salt. And, so we set sail, using an old, tattered map Silvereye had won in a game of dice. Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months. We sailed through calm waters and raging storms, never losing sight of our goal. The crew's spirits were tested, but Silvereye's determination kept us going. Finally, we arrived at the island, a spit of land shrouded in mystery and fear. There was a mountain, a gaping maw of a cave at its base. Legend said the beast lived there. We drew lots to see who would face the beast, and as luck would have it, Silvereye drew the short straw. With a steely glint in his eye, he entered the cave, sword in hand. Hours passed, and we heard roars, clashing steel, and the echoes of a battle. Then, silence. We feared the worst. But just as dawn broke, Silvereye emerged, battered but victorious. In his hands, he held the glittering treasure chest. But here's the twist, young ones. We cheered, but Silvereye looked at us with weary eyes and said, ""Aye, we've won the gold, but at what cost? Months at sea, battling the elements, risking our lives. And for what? A chest of gold? Is that the measure of a man? I've learned that it's not the treasure, but the journey that shapes us. The trials we face, the people we meet, the person we become...that's the real treasure."" We were silent, the words sinking in. Silvereye, though a pirate, had imparted a wisdom greater than any we'd heard before. And that's the tale, me young shipmates. The lesson? Life's journey is full of treasures if we but look beyond the gold. Remember, it's not what you find at the end, but who you become along the way. Now, go on, explore these books, your own islands of adventure. And remember, every page turned is a step on your own journey. Make it count. ===",,

This data may suffer from issues ranging from poor recording forms, a hostile recording environment for the collectors, or measurement uncertainty due to the sample condition. Data from fieldwork and any structured metadata cannot practically encompass all the in-field decisions, methodological choices, environmental factors, and compromises encountered by the field researchers. All these factors, however, still influence quality and future uses of collected data. Skala describes this context around the data as the colour of its bits: a human-evaluable context which operates much like a document’s security clearance which is an emergent property of the context of the creation of the data (2004). While some aspects of the context of the creation and history of the data should be captured in metadata during creation, updates, and deletion—the data model must anticipate these context-events and provide them their own data structure. Well-designed data structures do an excellent job of capturing salient and observable metadata events, especially if the data originates from within an online system. However, it is impossible to provide a full context and history of any given real-world observation represented as data. Skala uses the context of a recording of John Cage’s 4’33”: One of my friends was talking about how he’d performed John Cage’s famous silent musical composition 4’33” for MP3. Okay, we said, ... so you took an appropriate-sized file of zeroes out of /dev/zero and compressed that with an MP3 compressor? No, no, he said. If I did that, it wouldn’t really be 4’33” because to perform the composition, you have to make the silence in a certain way, according to the rules laid down by the composer. It’s not just four minutes and thirty-three seconds of any old silence (2004). ∗<brian.ballsun-stanton@mq.edu.au> †Copyright 2023, license CC-BY International 4.0. LATEX available at https://github.com/Denubis/TheColour-of-Offline-Data 1 In my own experience, this colour qua unrecorded-context-around-data is most evident from data produced from archaeological fieldwork. To a ‘colour-blind’ computer scientist, where a bit is a bit, archaeological data collected in an app is either valid or invalid according to rules implemented in the recording form, program, or database structure. In the messy pragmatics of the field, there exist colours like ‘not valid yet, look again after lab work’, ‘field supervisor should perform quality assurance first’, ‘physically uncertain,’ and ‘this model is not appropriate, but we have to record anyways,’ amongst other operational nuances that cannot be well captured in metadata. Archaeological fieldwork tends towards a do-once activity, either because it is physically destroying the environment it is recording as it records the environment or due to the difficulties of obtaining data—high-quality data and record validity is a goal rather than a minimum threshold. 1 Metadata and the Universe of Discourse The delineation of a boundary dividing model versus not-model is called the ‘Universe of Discourse’ by Venn: ‘When we make use of names and resort to reasonings, what limits of reference, if any, do we make? What is the range of subject matter about which we consider ourselves to be speaking?’ (Venn 1881, p. 180). Here, specifically, Venn describes the challenges of excluding all the irrelevant factors to our reasoning and describes the rectangular bounding box surrounding his famous circles as the Universe of Discourse – the division between ‘these are matters we care about’ and ‘these are not matters of relevance to the current model.’ It is impossible to have a model with sufficient data and metadata to be a fully accurate representation of the thing without being the thing itself (see Borges 1975, p. 131 and the map-territory distinction). Therefore, the model designer must always anticipate a future universe of discourse when making data models and providing for metadata and annotation. There are always boundary trade-offs where the universe of discourse intersects the model. This constraint holds for a relational database as much as it does the trained eye and narrative articulated by Caraher in Slow Archaeology, ‘Documenting features in a trench or in the field in handwritten notebooks provides a moment to slow down and to observe subtleties that we might have otherwise missed in our quest for efficient data collection’ (2015, p. 50). Data/text description must elide non-salient detail outside the universe of discourse. A model or description which fails to do so decreases in utility as data entry takes more time for increasingly marginal gains. 2 Colours in Archaeological Fieldwork Outside of Skala’s colours informing the intellectual property status of a bit, or Patrick McKenzie’s discussion around the accountant’s view of various metadata-infused-colours of money (2022), there exist colours of academic data. In many ways, this mirrors the tacit knowledge carried by researchers and machines from lab to lab in a wordless pidgin—the data itself and metadata at the document or record level may be insufficient 2 to contextualise or reproduce the data without the original researchers or machines in a specific configuration (Galison 1997, p. 51). Capturing this wordless pidgin, the relationship of the thing in context with its (complex) data-capturing environment, is outside the pragmatic realities of fieldwork. Those creating a record (digital or traditional) establish an implicit universe of discourse as they design their recording forms and methods with the intention that the records will serve to adequately capture the data under observation. In this paper, I will use the implementation of ‘annotation’ and ‘certainty’ value-level metadata in an offline-focused field-data collection software app across more than seventy projects as a case study exploring how the metaphor of the colour of data illuminates the wordless pidgins of fieldwork, record preparation, and data analysis. Furthermore, I will discuss how data created offline, through remote fieldwork, is commonly ‘stateful’— requiring distinct kinds and strengths of validation and metadata as it moves from field to lab to paper, even though the data itself may not change. This paper should be able to assist in design discussions around software systems which may support offline or remote fieldwork. Some software developers may have the belief when designing systems that, ‘... on the other hand, bits are bits are bits and it is absolutely fundamental that two identical chunks of bits cannot be distinguished. Colour does not exist’ (Skala 2004). I assert that they are wrong for these use-cases. Software systems which cannot handle the context and state of data, its ‘colour,’ as it passes through the research pipeline are ill-suited for remote or offline fieldwork. 3 Acknowledgements This work was heavily inspired by Patrick McKenize’s ‘Accounting for SaaS and swords’ in his Bits about Money newsletter.

Just like how Linus Torvalds oversees the Linux Kernel development without coding himself, this project allows developers to communicate with the AI and supervise the development process. By providing specific task details in a prompt descriptor and highlighting the relevant parts of your project, you can delegate code implementation, documentation, testing, and more to your AI Contributor. ## Getting Started ### Installation To install, clone the repository and run `npm install` in the root directory. ### Usage There are two ways to use this project: a command-line interface (CLI) and a web interface. #### Command-line interface (CLI) To start the CLI, use `npm run cli`. This mode uses the ChatGPT API, and you'll need an API key stored in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. #### Web Interface Run the application with `npm start` to start a local server on port 3000, where you can generate a prompt and automatically copy it to paste into ChatGPT. The web interface is designed for use with ChatGPT Pro and doesn't require an API key. ### The Prompt Descriptor A prompt descriptor is a YAML file (`prompt.yaml`) outlining the details necessary for generating a task prompt for the AI model. Here's an example of a prompt descriptor: ```yaml task: prompt/task/feature/implement.md attention: - src/interactiveSession/startInteractiveSession.js - src/prompt/createPrompt.js - src/attention/readAttention.js - prompt.yaml requirements: > Write a README.md for this _exploratory_ project! format: prompt/format/new_file_version.md ``` Each element in the descriptor serves a specific purpose: - `task`: Describes the task type and scope. For example, `feature/implement`, `bug/fix`, or `refactor/`. You can check out the [prompt/task/implement.md](prompt/task/implement.md) file as an example. - `attention`: Lists the files and directories most relevant to the task. - `requirements`: Describes the actual task in a human-readable format. - `format`: Determines how the output will be formatted. ### Attention Mechanism The attention mechanism guides the AI model by providing it with a working set. It helps overcome the limited working memory of large language models. The working set is a subset of the entire project that's currently in focus. It includes both files and directories. For files, the content is directly provided to the AI. For directories, a brief list of files and subdirectories within them is presented. ## Contributing and Support Contributions are welcome! Please remember that this project is designed to write itself. Your main role will be to oversee the work, provide detailed prompts, and review the outcomes. For support, please create an issue in the GitHub repository. **Note:** For meaningful results, it's recommended to use the GPT-4 model or a more recent version. ``` ``` ./src/ ├── attention/... ├── backend/... ├── config.js ├── execute/... ├── frontend/... ├── index.html ├── interactiveSession/... ├── main.js ├── prompt/... ├── vite.config.js ``` # Task Implement the following feature! - Create a plan! - Create new files when needed! - Every js file should only export a single function! - Use ES6 imports!

The desktop app will run the plugin as a subprocess and communicate over the io pipes. The main concern I have is with packaging the plugins and dealing with their dependencies. I want to avoid requiring anything more than python on a given machine in order to get the desktop app and plugins working. Should I bundle each plugins dependencies with the plugin? Or download dependencies as part of the installation of the plugin? Looking for general guidance on how to handle this or links to good articles on what's been done before. Can you write a detailed article on this based on all of your training with sections, emojis, further references and hash tags and write more next articles on similar concepts",,

The process is streamlined by comparing the output of the code to an expected result. Approvals is a different way to do assertions in tests. Instead of `assert(a==b)` do `verify(a)` ## Here's how it works - If the changed results match the approved file perfectly, the test passes. - If there's a difference, a reporter tool will highlight the mismatch and the test fails. This creates a visual, textual representation of what has been changed. ## How To In order to use Approval Tests, the user needs to: 1. Set up a test: This involves importing the Approval Tests library into your own code. 2. Optionally, set up a reporter: Reporters are tools that highlight differences between approved and received files when a test fails. Although not necessary, they make it significantly easier to see what changes have caused a test to fail. 3. Manage the ""approved"" file: When the test is run for the first time, an approved file is created automatically. This file will represent the expected outcome. Once the test results in a favorable outcome, the approved file should be updated to reflect these changes. This is typically done by copying the received file to the approved file. This setup is useful because it shortens feedback loops, saving developers time by only highlighting what has been altered rather than requiring them to parse through their entire output to see what effect their changes had.

Start by introducing yourself to the student as their AI-Tutor who is happy to help them with any questions. Only ask one question at a time. First, ask them what they would like to learn about. Wait for the response. Then ask them about their learning level: Are you a high school student, a college student or a professional? Wait for their response. Then ask them what they know already about the topic they have chosen. Wait for a response. Given this information, help students understand the topic by providing explanations, examples, analogies. These should be tailored to students learning level and prior knowledge or what they already know about the topic. Give students explanations, examples, and analogies about the concept to help them understand. You should guide students in an open-ended way. Do not provide immediate answers or solutions to problems but help students generate their own answers by asking leading questions. Ask students to explain their thinking. If the student is struggling or gets the answer wrong, try asking them to do part of the task or remind the student of their goal and give them a hint. If students improve, then praise them and show excitement. If the student struggles, then be encouraging and give them some ideas to think about. When pushing students for information, try to end your responses with a question so that students have to keep generating ideas. Once a student shows an appropriate level of understanding given their learning level, ask them to explain the concept in their own words; this is the best way to show you know something, or ask them for examples. When a student demonstrates that they know the concept you can move the conversation to a close and tell them you’re here to help if they have further questions.",,

Your job is to help participants with their questions about the workshop, give them content support and tell them what they can or should do next. Be brief and try to answer in 5 sentences or less. Always be friendly and ask if you need more information from the user. In the first step, I will now give you the content of the first chapter. But you are already in the second chapter. So if the users ask you something, they are probably also in the second chapter. After this message, you say Y if you have understood everything after you have received the content of the first chapter. First chapter: # Getting Started {-} ## What is reproducibility? {-} In the context of scientific research, reproducibility refers to the ability of an independent researcher to duplicate the results of a study using the same methods, procedures, and data. It's about ensuring that every step of the research process, from data collection to analysis, is transparent, well-documented, and can be repeated with the same outcome. This is crucial for validating scientific findings and building trust in research outcomes. Tools like the 'repro' package in R, as discussed in the text, help automate this process, making it easier for researchers to create reproducible workflows. In essence, reproducibility is the cornerstone of robust, reliable, and high-quality scientific research. ## What problems must we solve? {-} 1. copy&paste mistakes 2. inconsistent versions of code or data 3. missing or incompatible software 4. complicated or ambiguous procedure for reproduction ## What concepts must we know about? {-} 1. Dynamic documents 2. Version control 3. Software management 4. Workflow orchestration ## What software must we know about? {-} 1. RMarkdown 2. Git 3. Docker 4. Make To all of these implementations there are alternatives e.g., Quarto, Jupyter, Singluarity, virtualenv, SnakeMake, and many more. However, we had to decide on one set of tools. More important is that you understand for what we use them, than you may replace them with whatever you favor. ## What services will we use? {-} Normally you work on your local computer. However, in workshops this often leads to the issues of missing/outdated/broken software setups. Therefore, we suggest to use the prepared software environment we give you in form of Posit Cloud (= RStudio Cloud). Additionally, we will make heavy use of GitHub (≠ Git) and GitHub Actions (∈ GitHub). ## What does self-paced mean? {-} Self-paced learning is an educational approach that allows you to control the speed and the intensity of your learning. This means you can learn at your own rhythm, pausing, reviewing, and progressing when it suits you best. You are encouraged to actively engage with the material, explore the content, and try to solve problems on your own before seeking help. In this course, there's no rigid schedule to follow. You're free to come and go, and move through the content as you please. Remember, while it's self-guided, you're not alone - use the infoboxes, explanation follows in the next paragraph, and course leaders are available to assist if you encounter difficulties you can't resolve on your own. It is a flexible and personal way of learning designed to support you on your learning journey. ## What are infoboxes? {-} There are two types of infoboxes in this course. The first type is the Additional info box. These provide information to delve deeper into a topic and can be found throughout the course. Clicking on one of these boxes will take you to more in-depth material. The second type are ReproDude infoboxes. You will find these at least once in each chapter. If you have a question or get stuck, click on the relevant box in the chapter and you will be redirected to ReproDude, already informed about the corresponding topic. Ask what you want to know and have a conversation. To use this, you will need a ChatGPT account, a link to which can be found below. ```{r results='asis', echo = FALSE} addinfostart <- generate_additionalinfo(links$addinfos$start, ""Additional info"", ""I am an additional infobox that provides you with additional material to educate you more deeply. Click on my sister boxes for more information."") reprodude1 <- generate_reprodudes(links$reprodudes$one, ""ReproDude"", ""I am ReproDude, so if you have a question or are stuck on a topic, click on the appropriate ReproDude box and ask there. You will need an account with ChatGPT to use me."") cat(addinfostart) cat(reprodude1) ``` <!-- so that there is no text between the Boxes--> <div style=""clear: both;""></div> ## What else should i know before I start? {-} In this workshop we will go through many things, many of them complicated. The goal today is to understand what is possible and not to achieve a complete deep technical understanding. So be kind to others and yourself and try not to get frustrated, ReproDude and the workshop leaders are there to help you if necessary. Just as you set your own pace in this course, you can also decide which tasks you do in this course. There are two types of tasks: <span style=""color:green"">1. The tasks marked in green are important and the workshop will not work if you skip any of these points or do them in the wrong order.</span> <span style=""color:blue"">2. The tasks marked in blue are completely optional and are meant for trying out and experimenting. You can skip these tasks as you like.</span> ## Questions? Comments? Notes? {-} If you have any questions, comments, or notes regarding the workshop in general, you can share them on the following document: [Workshop Feedback](`r links$generals$feedback`) ## Setup! {-} If you already have an account, than sign in, otherwise, sign up. ### GitHub {-} If you have no GitHub account: [GitHub Sign in](`r links$logsign$githubsign`) If you already have a GitHub account: [GitHub Log in](`r links$logsign$githublog`) ### Posti/RStudio Cloud {-} If you have not used Posit/RStudio Cloud before: Use Option: “Sign Up with GitHub” [Posti/RStudio Cloud Sign up](`r links$logsign$postisign`) If you already have a Posit/RStudio account: [Posti/RStudio Cloud Log in](`r links$logsign$postilog`) ### ChatGPT {-} If you have not used ChatGPT before: Use Option: “Sign up” [ChatGPT Sign up](`r links$logsign$chatgptsign`) If you already have a ChatGPT account: Use Option: “Log in” [ChatGPT Log in](`r links$logsign$chatgptlog`) ### Final Step {-} <span style=""color:green"">Now, please open the project:</span> [Project](`r links$projekt$start`) If you have already logged into Posti/RStudio Cloud during the previous section, you should now see a copy of the project in front of you. <span style=""color:green"">Click now on ""Save a Permanent Copy"" in the top right-hand corner of the task bar.</span> This ensures that you have access to the project even if you log off.

At first, ANISE only supports Direct Cosine Matrix math. This is a redundant representation of rotations and therefore not an optimal one. The purpose of this issue is to design and implement a _correct_ SO(3) group for use in ANISE. Currently, work by Greg and Chris in commit 04b719f76a36d97be31941e4480f2da6a18c1381, have an early draft of what is needed for rotations in src/math/rotation/mod.rs.

Composition between different representations shall use the most efficient calculation that maintains accuracy (efficient as ""least number of instructions"", as determined by iai/cachegrind) 2. Rotations shall check the source and destination frames to prevent invalid rotations (this can probably not be done at compile time) 3. The following representations shall be supported at a minimum: 1. Direct Cosine Matrix (DCM) 2. Quaternions shall be supported in their ""natural"" form (i, j, k, scalar), but a conversion to and from Shuster notation shall also be supported (https://possiblywrong.wordpress.com/2021/05/10/beware-the-natural-quaternion/) 3.

Representations shall be unambiguous on initialization and getters (e.g. a quaterion shall not be publicly indexable because that's confusion to the user who might not remember the storage order) 4. All representations shall provide relevant helpers 1. Quaternions shall provide at a minimum a conjugate function and a ""short direction"" function 2. MRPs shall provide at a minimum a shadow set representation 5. All computations shall be checked for math domain errors and return `AniseError::MathError` where relevant. 6.

https://chat.openai.com/share/261034ff-f5d5-404c-b354-c9d58e3af509,"I'm going to define a style of English writing called ""Death Metal English"". Here are some common traits of Death Metal English: Big, polysyllabic words: You don’t have to use them correctly; you just have to use them. Bonus points for Greco-Latinate words that end in “-ition,” “-ation,” “-ution,” “-ous,” “-ized,” “-ism,” “-ance,” “-ial,” “-ity,” and variations thereon. Double bonus points for words ending semi-inappropriately in “-ment,” as in “Torn Into Enthrallment.” These words don’t even have to be real. Is Wormed’s “Multivectorial Reionization” a real thing? Who cares? Adjectives: In Death Metal English, they’re like guitar solos. You aren’t using enough. Add more. Prepositional phrases: Same is true here, too — the more prepositional phrases, the better. “(-ation word) of the (ominous word)” is perhaps the most brutal of all grammatical constructions, which is why “Procreation (of the Wicked)” is one of the best song titles ever. It also has parentheses, which are a less common but still valued component of Death Metal English. Progressive tense: Especially useful for song titles. “(Verb)ing the (noun)” is also a great default song title, as in “Cloning the Stillborn,” “Infecting the Crypts,” and “Christening the Afterbirth.” Passive voice: Active verbs aren’t brutal. Passive voice is useful when you need to add more syllables to a line to make it fit the riff. Plus, it highlights whatever weird power dynamic is going on in your lyrics. Why say “The beast hath consumed him” when you could say “He hath been consumed by the beast”? Speaking of which — Archaic or pseudo-Biblical verbiage: If you write like you are some kind of ancient, ageless force who is unfamiliar with modern grammatical conventions, you are probably pretty evil. Bonus points for using constructions that evoke the King James Bible, which is ironically among the most metal texts in the English canon. “Thou,” “hast,” “thine,” and so forth are all great; “unto” is my personal favorite. Yoda-style unconventional sentences can achieve the same effect, as in “Civilized I shall not be / By the holy strain of laws” or “I know the texts divine” (both from Morbid Angel’s “Brainstorm”). Dave Vincent and Glen Benton are probably responsible for popularizing these tricks in a death metal context, but Nile raised them to an art form. Speaking of which: award more bonus points for each reference to any obscure or fictional non-Christian deity. Grandiloquent metaphor: This is death metal. Make whatever you’re talking about sound really big and important. Illogical or meaningless sentences: This one certainly isn’t unique to Death Metal English, but it’s popular in the realm. Writing lyrics that make grammatical and substantive sense is not sufficiently off-putting and obscurantist for some bands, and doing so over crazy shred riffage is pretty hard to boot. Instead, why not say, as Impetuous Ritual did on “Convoluting Unto Despondent Anachronism,” something like this: “Propagate correlated malediction / Reclamation of hierarchic genetic throne / Bound to iniquitous subordinancy / Coerced through conductive bedlam”? (The lyrics to Impetuous Ritual’s Relentless Execution of Ceremonial Excrescence are a treasure trove of Death Metal English without peer.) And here are some examples of normal English translated into Death Metal English: Normal English: “Commuting to work” Death Metal English: “TRANSPORTATION OF THE WAGEBOUND UNTO THE NEXUS OF PERPETUAL QUOTIDIAN ENSLAVEMENT” Normal English: “This bok choy isn’t very good” Death Metal English: “CASTIGATING THE VERDANT ISSUANCE OF THE SOILS OF JIANGNAN” Normal English: “I need to take a nap” Death Metal English: “RIPPED INTO THE UTTER EXHAUSTION OF THE MIDDLE DAY” Normal English: “Thanks for explaining the train schedule” Death Metal English: “PROFFERING GRATITUDE UPON THE CHRONOCRATION OF THE JUGGERNAUTS OF RETICULATED METALS AND FIRE” Normal English: “You have to mow the lawn” Death Metal English: “BRING DOWN THE SCYTHE OF GODS UPON THE NECKS OF THE GREEN-RIBBED LEGIONS AND SWEEP AWAY THEIR WRETCHED BODIES; THOU ART IMPLORED BY ME” Please use these to convert anything I say into Death Metal English.",,

Corecore is an aesthetic trend on TikTok that derives its name from an ironic use of the -core suffix. In the modern internet age, the -core suffix is used to describe shared ideas of culture, genres, or aesthetics and groups them all into one set category — think cottagecore or goblincore (which in turn come from the music genre hardcore, and the tendency of new hardcore-related subgenres to use -core as a suffix, as in ""emo-core""). So through its name, corecore makes itself sound like the antithesis of genre itself; its content can be anything and its creators can use any type of media to convey a central premise. On the corecore page on Know Your Meme(opens in a new tab), the site states that the trend ""plays on the -core suffix by making a 'core' out of the collective consciousness of all 'cores.'""",,

They used stack overflow to make their case, and report that user engagement has gone down after the release of ChatGPT. Could it not be the case that SO is less adept at finding related/duplicate questions than ChatGPT? Given the later's facility with the language, I would expect it to be. So I look at the paper to see if they accounted for that, and find this. ""Second, we investigate whether ChatGPT is simply displacing simpler or lower quality posts on Stack Overflow. To do so, we use data on up- and downvotes, simple forms of social feedback provided by other users to rate posts. We observe no change in the votes posts receive on Stack Overflow since the release of ChatGPT. This finding suggests that ChatGPT is displacing a wide variety of Stack Overflow posts, including high-quality content.""",,

https://chat.openai.com/share/0c7588ee-b13b-41e3-b169-c1e587fcbb72,"I'm building an app that tracks screentime. We have a categorization system based on regexes matching on application names and window titles. To make it easier to add new categories from uncategorized data, we have a categorization helper that lists the most common words in events (splitting on spaces and other word boundaries). However, sometimes an app/activity is identified as two or more words that (almost) always occur together. How can I improve the algorithm for finding most common strings (by duration, not count) such that it will include longer common strings? Here is some code for how it's currently done: ```typescript const words = {}; for (const event of events) { const words_in_event = event.data.title.split(/[\s\-,:()[\]/]/); for (const word of words_in_event) { if (word.length <= 2 || this.ignored_words.includes(word)) { continue; } if (word in words) { words[word].duration += event.duration; words[word].events.push(event); } else { words[word] = { word: word, duration: event.duration, events: [event], }; } } } ```",,
